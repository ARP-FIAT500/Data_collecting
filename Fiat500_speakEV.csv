0,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.

We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
8,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?
 
"

Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.

"
13,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.
 
"
15,5306,srichards,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.
 
"
16,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

Noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric Fiat 500 are now on Youtube from the German reviewers.

The most interesting one that I came across is linked below (links jumps to charging section), however due to its length the auto generated closed captions aren't available.

Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger

Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW
26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time
42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve
At 85% charge rate drops to 13kW
Around 29 minutes from 7% to 85% - 29.4 kWh delivered in that time

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun.

A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout!
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.

Is it $5000 plus importation costs? or will it be more expensive than that?

So for an extra 20k you can have much improved..... I am assuming range, how much would that be per mile of additional and possibly un needed city car range.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:









Vehicle approval


Type approval, individual (IVA), motorcycle single vehicle approval, voluntary approval, certificate of initial fitness, accessibility approval, fees, forms, replacement certificates

Doesn't seem too hard.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Hi,
We are close to ordering a new fiat 500e, but I am interested in the service intervals and cost. The dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles..? Is this correct for an electric car.? Surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts.?
If anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated.

I've contacted my local dealer (not the one supplying ) and they said they didn't have any details on frequency nor cost ....... There's cars being driven I find it pretty unacceptable tbh. 

They said 'ah well - the cars probably won't need servicing for 12 months so we've got plenty of time'.......

Also we're picking ours up in September. We didn't get offered the servicing package. Is that a fiat wide offer or something the dealer can elect to provide?
 
"
73,78496,dsaunders70,Fiat 500e service intervals,"
I spoke to the dealer again when we placed our order yesterday... and they confirmed service is every 12 months...! This is ridiculous, my Skoda enyaq is every 24 months...!

There is an offer for fixed price servicing of £299 for 3 years... I think this is only available if using PCP finance..

"

"
78,3040,Hilltop Dave,Fiat 500e service intervals,"
Because most EV's have regenerative braking (to put energy back into the battery when slowing down or going downhill), the friction brakes do not get as much regular use as with ICE cars, so brake discs can get rusty through little use.

I think it would depend on the spec you want. The dealer network have some models in stock, or on order, so depending on your requirements, you may get lucky with a car in stock, or maybe one that is on order but not locked down, so you could add extras/colour options, but that would probably be 3 month wait for build and delivery.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:









Vehicle approval


Type approval, individual (IVA), motorcycle single vehicle approval, voluntary approval, certificate of initial fitness, accessibility approval, fees, forms, replacement certificates

Doesn't seem too hard.

135,5634,Biffa,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),"@Wastedspacer what is the situation with the 500e, are the indicators white, red or amber?

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

Zoe's are ok but not so easy to manoeuver and certainly not as much of a fun ride as the 500e. The 500e is incredibly nimble, great visibility and easy to park, the Zoe was certainly comfortable and had decent visibility but seemed to have the turning circle of a double-decker! The other downside to the most reasonably priced Zoe's were the rental batteries. .

Found this advisory suggesting import duties won't be an issue:

""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document ""

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

150,105197,Mark25810,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Hi there 

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks
 
"
151,98903,LaserTam,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.
 
"
152,105197,Mark25810,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"Just checked online and when I type fiat mode 3 charging cable it only chose the one you can use at public chargers or a home charger not the home plug socket one :/

"
156,98903,LaserTam,Setting charging schedule - menu missing,"
On the info screen, not the one behind the steering wheel. On the settings page, the is a tab called EV Pages, it then asks you to 'launch' and you then get charge settings as an option, one is schedules, and there is charge level. The levels is important to know, because there is a know bug, where the charge level resets to 1, just when you want a quick charge.

My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.
Cheers if you can assist.

just got a brand new 500e (passion model) and i have the app and can turn lights on, switch climate on etc ... should it also show tyre pressures, currently battery levels etc ... ? like it does on the advert ?

I have also just collected my Passion, so I feel your pain because I had the same issue.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

However, I have not got tyre pressures either. Not sure how to resolve that one.

I love the car and using more than I expected as this is our town car. Usually charge at home on Octopus Go , but do use free chargers at retail centres where/when available.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged.

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

The new Fiat 500e has been revealed and to me it looks like a very appealing prospect. Good looks, a much better interior than the current 500 and decent specs (including a 42kWh battery).

The prices sound keen and I think it would make a great alternative to the Mini Cooper SE and Honda e.

£29,000 after the grant?

I guess this is the new normal for electric super-minis?
 
"
280,13593,tophatron,2021 Fiat 500e,"
That appears to be the price for the ""loaded"" first editions (which is another general trend for car launches), they seem to be targeting a £21-25k figure for the regular models (including the £3k grant).
 
"
281,25425,Mickeypeach,2021 Fiat 500e,"
We are looking at a car for my wife, and it was between the Mini e and the Honda e, but I think we will wait and look at the Fiat 500 e convertible, she already has a Mini convertible. Once the lower costs are revealed, then I cannot see why if you are after a small car, you would choose the more expensive, shorter range cars (Mini and Honda e)
 
"
282,13593,tophatron,2021 Fiat 500e,"
Yeah, they seem to have pitched it pretty well. Will be interesting to see if the usual Fiat discounts are available too...
 
"
283,2505,cah197,2021 Fiat 500e,"If the US version is anything to go by, there will be. Seeing as FCA need to sell every EV they can to offset their fleet emissions on things like Jeeps and Maseratis.

Pricing now announced. Looks quite reasonable:









The New Fiat 500 Electric: Three Types, Two Battery Options


Fiat recently introduced its third body version of the new 500 model - the 3+1, with small rear doors - which will join the hatchback and cabrio.

286,13593,tophatron,2021 Fiat 500e,"
The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE. The 42kWh models look good though and the prices are reasonable, especially if they get the usual Fiat discounts... 
 
"
287,80086,,2021 Fiat 500e,"
Would this be the first official EV soft-top?
 
"
288,71,proddick,2021 Fiat 500e,"Smart is already available in soft top.

"
289,2505,cah197,2021 Fiat 500e,"Hopefully they will offer ridiculous deals to offset all those Jeep, Maserati and Ferrari sales!

Instead of paying money to Tesla. 
 
"
290,13593,tophatron,2021 Fiat 500e,"Now that sounds like a great idea! 
 
"
291,71,proddick,2021 Fiat 500e,"They haven't said they will join Tesla pool for 2021 so I think you will be correct 

I guess Jeep PHEV will help them too 
 
"
292,2505,cah197,2021 Fiat 500e,"They must be banking on mega electric 500 sales then.
 
"
293,71,proddick,2021 Fiat 500e,"Still 1.67x Supercredit in 2021 so selling BEVs is their best strategy...
 
"
294,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"
This might be a stupid question but I have looked everywhere in the car and even read the manual but I cannot find out where the screen wash goes or even how to get to it. Any clues?
 
"
295,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Crikey, I thought this was going to ask which one is best to use etc.
They are usually up the front under a blue lid but you know all that.

2018 user manual shows item 6 front left as you look at it.

Gaz
 
"
296,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"Lol ya not that bad. I can been find where to open the bonnet (not a proud moment). I have not clue!
 
"
297,107349,Rbrian,Screen wash,"Look for a lever in the left hand side footwell, near the bottom door hinge. That should release it, but only partly. Then put your fingers through the gap between the bonnet and the grill which just opened when you pulled the lever, and find a catch. Pull that, and you'll be able to open the bonnet.
 
"
298,70828,Naturetech,Screen wash,"
Ask a Fiat dealer. If no joy, try another etc.
 
"
299,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"I saw a YouTube video where it's on the right and a manual where it's on the left.
By the sound of it the issue might be opening the bonnet to begin with.

Sure there's someone that owns either the original 500e or if the newer one is out whichever the OP has and can give explicit instructions.

Gaz
 
"
300,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"I tried looking there the other day could did see anything (other than the back up door release). I’ll have a look again in the morning.
 
"
301,94614,LeccyLew,Screen wash,"
This is the extract from the Fiat 500e 2021 manual, shows where the bonnet release is and the location of screen wash. I’m hoping that will help, I don’t own a Fiat 500e, but I was bored so went hunting about for it!















 
"
302,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"
Bless you.
Now if someone can make head or tail of what the bonnet release picture is actually supposed to show anyone we're onto a winner.

There is this youtube thing, I played it without the sound and got the impression that whoever made it is a bit of a peanarse
Still, if it makes sense it's worth a look.
For RHD the release will still be on the left hand side of the car.






Gaz
 
"
303,37345,Boxbrownie,Screen wash,"There is only one left and one right side of a vehicle, and it’s always (industry protocol) from the drivers viewpoint, so it can never be confused by LHD/RHD 
 
"
304,4626,,Screen wash,"
I will get some popcorn and wait for the next chapter on how to release the childproof lid on a plastic bottle of ready-to-use screenwash. I might make a YouTube video tutorial though as clearly there is a pressing need for such vital information.

( Geddit? - Clue - 'Pressing' )
 
"
305,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"Cheers, I looked in my manual 2022 and bother on! Will give this so go. Thank you

"
306,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Think about the release lever to adjust the steering wheel. It goes with the steering.
People often think everything else does too including the bonnet release.
Clarifying where something might be can sound silly but one has to put things into a context the person asking the question will understand.
Besides that I claim to have 2 left feet and that's that.  🦵🦵🕺

Gaz
 
"
307,107349,Rbrian,Screen wash,"Yep, I've always understood left and right, but still not sure about nearside and offside. Near to what? The kerb, or oncoming traffic? What about if you park on the other side of the road? And what's football got to do with cars?
 
"
308,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Nearside is just stupidness!
Have never liked the term.
Near the kerb I think but why not take something almost everyone on the planet understands like left and right and cock it up so much that even the motor industry send the wrong handed bits to each other because some fuckwit ordered a nearside thingy from a country that drives on the wrong side of the road.

Gaz
 
"
309,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Are you able to attach a photo?

If you open the passenger door and take a photo of the area underneath where the passengers knees would go the lever should be towards the left but we might be able to figure it out from a picture.
I always struggle to find the lever to open the fuel flap if I hire a car, almost invariably with barely enough fuel to reach the nearest petrol station.

Gaz
 
"
310,4626,,Screen wash,"You will need to buy a pair of Flip Flips then for your beach holiday.

Or at least two pairs of Flip Flops and discard the right side Flop Flops.
 
"
311,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"2 pairs if they are more than 99p

Gaz
 
"
312,91335,Ado,Screen wash,"
Bonnet release is a red lever under glove box.
 
"
313,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"It was in my old Fiat 500, but not in the new 500e!
 
"
314,91335,Ado,Screen wash,"
I have a 2022 500e and it is there, it took me a while but it is under the glove box.
 
"
315,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash," Will check again when I finish work. It’s so stupid at this point
 
"
316,6825,,Screen wash,"
Ooh the suspense! 🍿
 
"
317,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"I can safely say I have never felt more stupid then I do! Am hoping it will all be-over soon and I can feel like less of a dick😑😅
 
"
318,6825,,Screen wash,"
I'm only kidding, we all have our moments! 🤗
 
"
319,37345,Boxbrownie,Screen wash,"And in the manual it says “the steering column adjustment lever is located under the steering wheel column”. Now that side would that be on? 
 
"
320,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Hey, have you sorted this out yet?

@Ethanedwards is a good bloke, I bet he'd know the answer.

Gaz
 
"
321,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"Exactly my point, you seem to be having a bit of an off day for some reason.
Chin up fella, tomorrow brings more weather, more air to take in and more silly questions.
If only the picture in the manual gave a bit more context it'd all be over by now.

Gaz
 
"
322,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"The picture in the manual looks really confusing.
OK the OP seems to have confused something with the door release lever which is actually in the door but where they show the layout of the dash they could have easily included the bonnet release lever. At least the safety catch seems clear enough.

Gaz
 
"
323,107937,EmaBC,Screen wash,"Yes the mystery is over! Found it this morning. Under the glovebox, we’ll near enough part of the hing that’s part of the glove box. 
Stupid place to put it, don’t know what the didn’t just keep it like the non-electric 500.
Anyway still feel like an idiot😅.
 
"
324,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"The new 500 is a completely different car but they make the same mistakes in every manual showing a picture of something too close up so you have no point of reference to work put where it is.

Now, onto the actual screenwash...

Gaz
 
"
325,37345,Boxbrownie,Screen wash,"Non of my days are off, plenty of fresh air, sea breeze with an ozone bouquet and sunshine all around, topped with wine and fresh baked crunchy bread…….and that’s just before breakfast 
 
"
326,37345,Boxbrownie,Screen wash,"You’ll be in great company here 
 
"
327,100136,Peirpoint,Screen wash,"There have been plenty to go around.

328,101999,bighardyfamily,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"
just got a brand new 500e (passion model) and i have the app and can turn lights on, switch climate on etc ... should it also show tyre pressures, currently battery levels etc ... ? like it does on the advert ? 

any help would be greatly appreciated as i am pulling my hair out .... and the dealership are about as much use.
 
"
329,98903,LaserTam,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"
I have also just collected my Passion, so I feel your pain because I had the same issue.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

However, I have not got tyre pressures either. Not sure how to resolve that one.

"
332,98020,Cinquecento,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"
I empathise . Had similar issues . My dealer was useless and I turned to Fiat Customer Services for issues . Yes software problems do continue . eg. I frequently have to to reset the radio to get the live traffic information to show on the navigation system. 
I love the car and using more than I expected as this is our town car. Usually charge at home on Octopus Go , but do use free chargers at retail centres where/when available.

341,105572,Bedworth147,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"Hi, I am looking to swap the wifes car from a kia picanto to the fiat 500 electric Red edition. I am used to electric as i have had an Ipace for the last year. Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.
Cheers if you can assist.

Dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 3.12 kWh/mile but costs low combined with a few free PodPoints and overnight tariff works out at 1.8p/mile so overall PCP and running costs favour EV over a new petrol Fiat 500. Basically if you spend over £100/month on petrol and range is enough (160 miles) then 500e should be 1st choice for Fiat fans.

Anyone else keep stats?

I have 4.2 kWh/mile since delivery in July. Total of 2600 miles.This is a mixture of Urban & Rural, and small amount of motorway . I am on Octopus Go (5p per kW.) so it works out about 1.3p per mile. Expecting this to change a little with the colder weather. Very pleased overall with the car .

Anyone else looking forward to the new 500e finally reaching our shores next year? Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

Already had the nice Fiat lady from Italy calling to keep me informed and to congratulate me on my good taste in cars...

I'll post any updates here!

I really like the look of them, especially the fabric roof like you say - not enough convertible EVs! This is half way there... 

I also think it is a really nice evolution of the new Fiat 500 design. The interior looks fantastic. 

Looking forward to some photos when you get yours!

393,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"We‘ve had a reservation for one since April 2020, it’s a replacement for wife’s current Twin Air 500. Personally I think Fiat have nailed it with this, more than any other manufacturer. The internal and external styling is spot on and I can’t wait to have a spin in it. Sure it won’t be as fast as my current car but I know which one I’d rather be in on the coast roads in the summer.......

I have also registered my interest in the New 500 La Prima. There is a frustrating lack of real information on the UK website.
However it is possible to configure a La Prima on the Fiat Italy website, which gives a better idea of the specification (albeit in Italian).
Of course UK spec might be a bit different.

Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

Once the initial demand has subsided, they will likely offer some good deals as this is FCA’s leading car to offset all those Jeeps and Maseratis.

402,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"That's interesting.
On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
403,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.
 
"
413,7126,MarkyM,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

"
416,25425,Mickeypeach,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"The noise was fine, my wife currently has a mini convertible so she is used to extra noises.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

428,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
436,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now 
 
"
441,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box.

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
449,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

"
453,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

That's a scary bit of kit, certainly not safe to use here, and has no safety approval at all. It can't have, as you cannot draw 3 kW from a standard BS1363 outlet, the maximum is about 2.3 kW.

470,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any," The timer is good, I'd need 10m though I think plus the review says it's only shower proof so needs to be sheltered so not sure it would be ok as I don't have any shelter it's a open drive.

A silly question but if I plug this into the normal mains socket and into the car ...and not use the timer on the cable itself does it actually start charging right away or do you have to activate it via the car or cars app. Asking because it would be handy to set the timer via the app or car for a granny cable incase you have one without built in timer.
 
"
471,83879,Tandy0,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Yes, it does charge immediately if you don't set the timer. There is no app. You just plug it in and press the button for how many hours delay you need. BTW, you'll need a type 2 one for the Fiat I believe.

Deffo won't be getting a home charger now, watched a video on YouTube of someone going over what your house needs, we have the 100amp fuse but we do not have a new style consumer box, ours is the original that came when house was built in 79.

"

Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.
 
"
475,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right? Speak to your local qualified electrician. You can get fixed up a lot cheaper than you might think. 7kw will charge the 500 overnight with ease. A granny charger twice as long.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:









Vehicle approval


Type approval, individual (IVA), motorcycle single vehicle approval, voluntary approval, certificate of initial fitness, accessibility approval, fees, forms, replacement certificates

Doesn't seem too hard.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

Zoe's are ok but not so easy to manoeuver and certainly not as much of a fun ride as the 500e.

""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document ""

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
556,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.

What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

It is the Fiat 500e La prima 42kWh, know if it’s the convertible only or not, but it’s a car I was surprised of liking myself (not the convertible).
Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

Once the initial demand has subsided, they will likely offer some good deals as this is FCA’s leading car to offset all those Jeeps and Maseratis.

592,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"That's interesting.
On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
593,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.
 
"
603,7126,MarkyM,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
673,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
674,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
687,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

688,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
696,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"

"
701,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm.

704,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

706,93109,Wastedspacer,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),"
I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Hi all 
I’m a first time car owner and got myself the Fiat 500e.

So I wanted to ask - do you normally fix yours as soon as damaged?
Shall I take it where I bought it from to fix or just find someone locally to repair? 
Is there any type of protection I can add to avoid dents and scratches?
Thanks

769,13593,tophatron,500e Test Drive,"
After being interested in the 500e for quite a while, I was finally able to have a test drive last week at my local Fiat garage. Looks like I was the first to try it, as it only had 8 miles on the clock!

In general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500. I always loved the look of the old 500, and actually bought one in 2009. However I sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive. This new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way.

Positives:

Looks great in the metal.
Finally a good driving position in a 500! Lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel. You can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500.
The central display in the La Prima I drove was responsive and crisp, wireless CarPlay worked faultlessly.
Radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well.
Performance felt decent. Nippy away from the lights.
Amazing turning circle!
I didn't have time to fully test the efficiency, but it seemed pretty good. Range was stated at 160 miles at 100% when I first got in, I drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mi/kwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7% used and 147 miles left on the GOM. 

Negatives

Although the interior looks great, there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap.
The ride was generally good, but it tended to thump over serious bumps. Nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though.

Overall I really liked it! It's a pity I couldn't keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what it's like to live with. I'd also be interested to see what deals are available, at the right price it could be a really compelling package!

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
774,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

779,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Thank you for this I as you can tell am totally new to all this and sometimes it's hard to understand without a proper explanation.

I think I will get the car and see how I got with public chargers till I can afford a home wallbox, even with the grant the cheapest I saw was £500 and some upto £1200 still to pay which i don't have the money for at all.the fast chargers near me are at a pub I meet my friend at once a month and we are usually nattering for 3 hours and then walk around the shops for another hour

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

That's a scary bit of kit, certainly not safe to use here, and has no safety approval at all. It can't have, as you cannot draw 3 kW from a standard BS1363 outlet, the maximum is about 2.3 kW.

How on earth sellers are allowed to sell non-approved stuff here remains a mystery. Trading Standards really should be jumping all over these people.

"
795,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any," The timer is good, I'd need 10m though I think plus the review says it's only shower proof so needs to be sheltered so not sure it would be ok as I don't have any shelter it's a open drive.

A silly question but if I plug this into the normal mains socket and into the car ...and not use the timer on the cable itself does it actually start charging right away or do you have to activate it via the car or cars app. Asking because it would be handy to set the timer via the app or car for a granny cable incase you have one without built in timer.
 
"
796,83879,Tandy0,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Yes, it does charge immediately if you don't set the timer. There is no app. You just plug it in and press the button for how many hours delay you need. BTW, you'll need a type 2 one for the Fiat I believe.
 
"
797,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Oh I meant the fiat EV app, for setting charging timer not a timer for the actual Amazon cable.

Yeh I had to message the lease company to see if there was a free granny cable with the car but they said it only comes with the type 2 charger cable that is standard with most EV cars, so I can use that at public places that need a cable, though can't afford a home wallbox so it may not get much use as I think I will use a fast charger more
 
"
798,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
Deffo won't be getting a home charger now, watched a video on YouTube of someone going over what your house needs, we have the 100amp fuse but we do not have a new style consumer box, ours is the original that came when house was built in 79.

It's a metal flush rectangle with a metal lid that drops down and a town of black switches that turn sections of house off and then 1 bigger switch for everything turning off...that's it.
 
"
799,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.
 
"
800,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.
 
"
801,4866,BogieMan,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"EBay take no responsibility for the safety of electrical items on their site. I bought an adaptor for Shucko to 3 pin from eBay and when I used it the fuse tripped. The photo shows the adaptor partly disassembled, and the pencil shows where the earth connector and live connector touch when the shucko is inserted into the adaptor. EBay were not interested, the only recourse is to get your money back if you’re still alive.
There is a pressure group trying to change this but they are not getting very far unfortunately.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right? Speak to your local qualified electrician. You can get fixed up a lot cheaper than you might think. 7kw will charge the 500 overnight with ease. A granny charger twice as long.

Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

Already had the nice Fiat lady from Italy calling to keep me informed and to congratulate me on my good taste in cars...

I'll post any updates here!

Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
815,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.
 
"
816,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.
 
"
825,7126,MarkyM,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.

Anyone else looking forward to the new 500e finally reaching our shores next year? Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

Already had the nice Fiat lady from Italy calling to keep me informed and to congratulate me on my good taste in cars...

I'll post any updates here!








 
"
859,247,Charlie S,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
I really like the look of them, especially the fabric roof like you say - not enough convertible EVs! This is half way there... 

I also think it is a really nice evolution of the new Fiat 500 design. The interior looks fantastic. 

Looking forward to some photos when you get yours!
 
"
860,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"We‘ve had a reservation for one since April 2020, it’s a replacement for wife’s current Twin Air 500. Personally I think Fiat have nailed it with this, more than any other manufacturer. The internal and external styling is spot on and I can’t wait to have a spin in it. Sure it won’t be as fast as my current car but I know which one I’d rather be in on the coast roads in the summer.......

I have also registered my interest in the New 500 La Prima. There is a frustrating lack of real information on the UK website.
However it is possible to configure a La Prima on the Fiat Italy website, which gives a better idea of the specification (albeit in Italian).
Of course UK spec might be a bit different.

Elmo will be offering it as a subscription car (all included, no deposit).
It is the Fiat 500e La prima 42kWh, know if it’s the convertible only or not, but it’s a car I was surprised of liking myself (not the convertible).
Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

Once the initial demand has subsided, they will likely offer some good deals as this is FCA’s leading car to offset all those Jeeps and Maseratis.
 
"
869,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"That's interesting.
On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
870,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.
 
"
871,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.
 
"
880,7126,MarkyM,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

"
883,25425,Mickeypeach,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"The noise was fine, my wife currently has a mini convertible so she is used to extra noises.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

895,107730,10uptobase,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"
Hi again all

So today I am on a first long trip (135 miles) and want to optimise range. Hoping for just one stop. Other than Sherpa and sensible sedate driving, not using electrics etc, what else can I do? E.g. warming up the batteries? I dont as yet have a mobile app, so needs to be all doable in the car. If I top up the charge with the cabin heating on just before departure, will this help get the batteries up to temp?

Second part, Im going for 100% charge due to the long trip, but generally bet to take up to around 80% to maximaise the battery life?

Many thnaks!
 
"
896,98903,LaserTam,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"
The climate function is for the cabin only I belive, I don't think there is a battery warming function. But pre-climate the cabin while still charging will obviously help. If charging at home, goto 100%, the recommendation of not regularly going to 100% is on fast chargers. In any case, the last 20% on a fast charger is very slow, so taking to 80-85% is good. Sherpa or range modes help with range. If on motorways, keep speed down if time isn't precious.
 
"
897,107730,10uptobase,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"Thanks for that. Thought I had read somewhere that it was possible to pre heat the battery pack as well as the cabin, but could be wrong. Picking a route that favours lower speeds and is about the same distance as motorway so I don't feel too out of place!
 
"
898,93356,whyone,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"
The Fiat app is shocking both in the extent of its functionality and stability. 

There is no battery pre-conditioning option.
 
"
899,106641,Leccy Red,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"This is interesting. How do you define home chargers and fast chargers? I am currently using my 'granny' charger at 2.3Kh whilst awaiting installation of my 'fast' home charger which will handle 7Kh. Is that what you mean by fast or are you referring to the very fast DC chargers?
 
"
900,98903,LaserTam,Another new owner question! - pre conditioning and optimising battery life.,"
Yes, by fast, I mean the DC chargers, 50kw and above.

901,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"
Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

I don’t know what Renault were thinking, they have a crazy good formula with the Zoe for price vs range/spec… then throwing it away for the sake of a few safety features, mind blowing! Really like the styling of the 500e thou… just the kids are the concern before we commit.

We need to book a test drive really but it’s such a faff aligning schedules etc

The Renault Zoe / Nissan LEAF 🙈

The only two I'd suggest, the Born making the ID.3 look like plain porridge.

ID.3 / Cupra Born ✅

Then the small segment:

The Fiat which I think looks ace:

911,93356,whyone,Kids in the backseat,"
We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR)

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.
 
"
912,86600,D57,Kids in the backseat,"
I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e...

I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching.
I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK.
The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

914,97958,tsh2,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Has anyone else noticed this? I'm using scheduled charging and finding very frequently that the car ends up charging at 6A rather than 30A.













Fiat say take it to a dealer to they can pull the logs, and won't investigate otherwise. It would be good to know if this is a widespread problem. Its fairly high on the nuisance list since we rely on being able to charge different cars on different days and have an off-peak tariff.
 
"
915,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Picked up my new 500 today, so will look out for this issue. Probably a stupid, but related question (dealer couldn’t answer): what charging level should I be using if I’m charging the car once a week…why wouldn’t I always put it on 5? Thanks in advance.
 
"
916,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
I don’t have a Fiat & have no experience with this…
it looks weird, with no real information on the settings 
Dumb question, how are you charging it? Is this with the granny charger? If so I’d expect it to be at the lowest level - those things are slow, not usually going over 10A
if it’s with the wall charger, do you have 7.2kw/32A (or 3.6kw/16A)
But as @TRC7 not sure why you wouldn’t always set it to “5” 

perhaps someone else will be able to be more help 🤷‍♂️
 
"
917,3413,Oilymo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Yes we’ve seen this issue, although ours dropped to 3, it’s a known software bug. There are also other items that get changed, looking beep and display units to name two.

Are you on the Facebook Group? You might get a quicker response if you post there.
 
"
918,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
@Mofo thanks. I guess to ask my question another way (and apologies if I’m taking the thread off on a tangent), is there any benefit to charging more slowly, if you don’t need a quick charge? I always thought the charge speed was determined by the power output of the charger (and size of the battery). Here, Fiat seem to be giving you an option to vary the charge speed within a particular power output, but don’t seem to explain why you would want to do that.
 
"
919,98020,Cinquecento,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
My seems to default to Level 3 , so when scheduling the charge , I just confirm to Level 5 . I need the Level 5 so as to charge at 7KW in my 4 hour window of cheap rate ( 5p per KW with Octopus Go ).
 
"
920,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"Charging more slowly can be kinder to the battery, but to a point…
rapid charging (50+kw) most damaging but can still be done many times
but the charging you do at home/destinations (7kW 32A) doesn’t make much difference, the lower settings are there for people with restrictions, such as 60A home fuse, so not enough capacity to have a full 7kW 32A, instead they’ve got 3.6kW 16A outlet, or others only have a 13A socket, so use the granny charger, these are limited to 10A (but could be put down to 6A, if you have the settings/need to), to protect the wiring/socket/connection as you don’t usually have something at 13A running full chat for maybe 12hrs, causing any weakness to overheat & possibly set fire
Though the lower Amps you charge at, the less efficient the charging is, so that’ll cost more, but this is only a tiny amount
hoping that makes some sort of sense 🙂

Super helpful, thanks very much 👍
 
"
922,97958,tsh2,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Two reasons to charge slowly for me. I can get 6 or 8 A 'free' on a clear day from my solar panels, and if I need to use an extension on my Tesla granny charger, I end up using the 16A adaptor rather than the 13A socket, so I need to set 3/5 to get a comfortable 10A (I have a europe friendly set of adaptors and extensions).
 
"
923,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"Yes! I used to do this, before I had my charge point put in, that is use the granny set low, so that it equalled out my 4kW solar panels 🙂

924,93109,Wastedspacer,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),"
I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun.

A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout!
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments

927,2505,cah197,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),"
Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged.

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

974,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.

987,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

Hi There,

My wife bought a Fiat 500e last June and I have to say it is a fantastic car. However, one question I have is.... Fiat claims the car's WLTP range is good for 199 miles but when fully charged the dash says the range is 161 miles! Is there some sort of safety margin here? 

This has been like this for some time - so when the weather was warmer.

I wonder if any of you can shed some light on this?

Cheers 

Austin

'They all do that sir' . Mine is the same and seems all owners experience the same. WLTP figures are just like the claimed MPG in ICE cars - calculated based on a specific test which is not like the real world. But it is very odd that everyone has range of 161 miles at 100% Soc, suggesting the software has adjusted it. Very read some people saw 190 range when they first purchased the car, I don't recall seeing that personally.
 
"

"
997,75416,,Reduced Range,"
I've posted this before, but it is an illustration as to just how different the true range of all cars, no matter what fuel they use, is from the advertised range. In 2005 I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid, and decided to monitor its performance to see how much more efficient it was when compared to other cars I'd owned.

That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles.

The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality.

The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis. The fuel tank held around 5 gallons and they might manage to get 40mpg if driven carefully. That meant that they had a maximum range of no more than about 200 miles, and in reality the range was a fair bit less than that most of the time.

It's a known fault with the car discussed on the Facebook car owners forum at some length.

"
999,91962,idiotzoo,Reduced Range,"
The indicated range is a fiction. The max range is essentially the usable battery capacity multiplied by the car’s supposed efficiency. So if you can achieve 4 miles/kWh and have a 42kWh battery with 37.3kWh usable, then the range is 149 miles.

4 miles/kWh is pretty good this time of year and you probably won’t manage that. 3.5 is more realistic, so the range is then 130.

to get 199 miles from 37.3 kWh usable means hitting over 5 miles/kWh which is… optimistic. Then again it’s a city car by design so in summer, with very careful driving, you might manage it.

More realistic is just 4.3miles/kWh which gives you the 161 range.

The more I think about it, have they massively cocked up and stated the car’s range based on the full battery capacity rather than the usable capacity?
 
"
1000,95742,Smitten,Reduced Range,"
You need a purpose built EV with a slippery outside shape like a model 3 to exceed 4 miles/kWh in winter. Our e208 is giving about 3.3 m/kWh now and it has a 45kW battery. So 199 miles is fantasy from a 37kW battery. Most we have had in the summer is 170 miles of actual driving (150 motorway plus 20 left at journeys end). Which brings me to my second point, you don't drive the car from full to empty. You probably start with 80% or so and end up with 10 to 15% so your range is already reduced.
 
"
1001,1604,Lexden,Reduced Range,"
In many EVs, range in cold weather can be maximised if the cabin and battery are pre-conditioned before departure whilst the car is still connected to an EVSE. As stated above, damp roads and the use of heating; lighting and wipers are a constant battery drain. Cold weather range reduction of 25% is not uncommon in some wet and cold wintry conditions. I have also had days when the GOM range has dropped quickly post departure, only to stabilise and increase as cabin temperature stabilises.

"
1004,104462,AustinM64,Reduced Range,"Ah, interesting; that explains a lot. I went to Brighton yesterday which for me was about 85 miles. If I couldn't get a charging point I planned a 20 min top-up at Cobham Services on the M25. As 90% of my journey was on the motorway, and they were clear, I spent the majority of that time at 70 mph. The 85-mile journey took nearly 140 miles off the 'range'. In the time I was there, I charged the car back to 85%. On the journey back I stayed at 60 mph and this time the 85-mile journey consumed approximately 105 miles of 'range'. 

I drove these journeys in the 'Range Mode' which did help. I note that in 'Sherpa Mode' the car asks you to limit the speed to 50 mph.

It's a learning curve I guess ......but it is still a great car!

"
1006,50,Paul_Moxhay,Reduced Range,"The indicated range on any EV is only ever an estimate but with most it is an educated estimate in that it adjusts the indicated range based on how the car was driven over the recent past. Many of us call it a ""guestimate"" and the range indicator we often call the ""Guess'o'Meter"" or GoM  Drive the car hard then not only will you get less actual range but from then on the car will assume that it will be driven hard and the estimate will be lower. Drive the car gently for a period and the car assumes more gentle driving for the future and so the estimate will go up. 

Also... the faster you drive the less range you will get so you seeing a drop in indicated range reduction when you drove slower is to be expected.
 
"
1007,75416,,Reduced Range,"
That was the very best figure, though. Even under optimum conditions there was a ~9% range shortfall compared with the spec. In winter the range was only about 76% of the specification figure, so about a 24% shortfall.

That's comparable with some EVs. My car has a spec that gives a WLTP range of 292 miles, in reality is does around 270 miles in ideal conditions (an 8% shortfall versus the spec) and about 210 miles in worst case conditions (a 28% shortfall versus the spec). This isn't wildly different to the ICE car variation, is it?

The peculiar thing about the 500 is that once fully charged it always claims a range of 161.6 (don't forget the .6!) miles. 

All of the other EV's I've experienced (we have a Tesla Model 3 and a VW ID.3 in the household) at least pretend to play the game and vary the estimated range a little after each charge!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:









Vehicle approval


Type approval, individual (IVA), motorcycle single vehicle approval, voluntary approval, certificate of initial fitness, accessibility approval, fees, forms, replacement certificates

Doesn't seem too hard.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

As @freddym , the EcoHarmony/Viridian 5m is £102.00 Inc. VAT + delivery (free for slow, £7.40 for fast) but plus fitting.

Where in the country are you?

Sorry, couldn't resist. I hope you get this solved.
 
"
1109,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"So if it's just supplied within a box in the boot, it does appear that it's a case of like it or lump it. In which case the advice to just replace the cable with a longer one seems ok. Viridian is a decent company to deal with. If you are confident that you can isolate the supply to the Wallbox, this is probably a DIY job, not much different to changing a plug.
 
"
1110,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Who installed the EASY WALLBOX. Is it wired up to deliver 7kW. Did the installer check that it worked, with a simulation box, on an actual EV?
 
"
1111,93356,whyone,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"If, as it sounds from the above, this item is supplied as part of the cars standard equipment, I don't see that you have any basis for complaint. 

It may be 'penny pinching', I am quite sure it is frustrating, but it is what FIAT supply and if it doesn't suit your particular situation, I think that is just unfortunate.
 
"
1112,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"The reason I ask is if you modify the charger by swooping the cable, you probably will have lost any warranty rights. So did the installer actually check that the Easy Wallbox actually works. Did they give you any paperwork to record the same.
How do you know the installation is compliant with wiring regs? Has the DNO been informed?

You are probably very lucky that the charging lead is too short.
 
"
1117,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
1118,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

1119,15145,.Tom.,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
I asked on another thread about what you get in the car. 

Looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug ( not bad but not ideal) as our dumb Rolec charger is nearly 6 years old I'm thinking of upgrading however there isn't any costs cited and dealership doesn't have details. 

Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me £249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat. Dumb also means the energy providers can't tax use (which Im assuming will be enviable) as it's invisible to them so reluctant to give the Rolec up.

Thoughts?
 
"
1120,2505,cah197,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
I’d stick with the Rolec.

Ours is also 6 years old and going strong. Just needed an RCBO replacement two years ago.
 
"
1121,25425,Mickeypeach,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
The easywallbox is not that smart it's only bluetooth to the phone app, to start or set a programming schedule and see some stats. I'm thinking of replacing our current charger as it's not tethered. So it should just need the electrician to disconnect the current charger and replace with the new one. No cabling to be done to the boards.
 
"
1122,98860,GibboEV,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
In the UK you can get a grant of £350 to have an EV Wallbox installed. This is useful if you want to upgrade to the 7.4kW connection. The chargepoint / wallbox has to be on the government's approved list but despite there fact that here are at least 100 on there, the easyWallbox isn't listed. It's made by an italian company called Free2Move (link below) but they aren't on the list either. The Fiat dealers I have called barely understand the question, let alone have the answer. My easyWallbox is free with the car but if I had to pay for the box I would choose one on the government grant list and shop around for an installer.

easyWallbox is a device that when fixed to the wall is the quickest and simplest way to charge at home. Just plug-in and… that’s it!

I swapped out my un-tethred Chargemaster for the new tethered easywall box, and it was fairly simple. Just make sure yout turn the little control knob to position 7, then download the 2nd app ""easywallbox powerup"" app, and change the safety limit to 32a 7.4kw. No issues so far. It's putting in 7KW per hour.

Hi There,

My wife bought a Fiat 500e last June and I have to say it is a fantastic car. However, one question I have is.... Fiat claims the car's WLTP range is good for 199 miles but when fully charged the dash says the range is 161 miles! Is there some sort of safety margin here? 

This has been like this for some time - so when the weather was warmer.

I wonder if any of you can shed some light on this?

Cheers 

Austin
 
"

'They all do that sir' . Mine is the same and seems all owners experience the same. WLTP figures are just like the claimed MPG in ICE cars - calculated based on a specific test which is not like the real world. But it is very odd that everyone has range of 161 miles at 100% Soc, suggesting the software has adjusted it. Very read some people saw 190 range when they first purchased the car, I don't recall seeing that personally.
 
"
1262,104462,AustinM64,Reduced Range,"

At the end of the day, the “range showing” is a guess by the car, .

"
1265,75416,,Reduced Range,"
I've posted this before, but it is an illustration as to just how different the true range of all cars, no matter what fuel they use, is from the advertised range. In 2005 I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid, and decided to monitor its performance to see how much more efficient it was when compared to other cars I'd owned.

That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles.

The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality.

The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis. The fuel tank held around 5 gallons and they might manage to get 40mpg if driven carefully. That meant that they had a maximum range of no more than about 200 miles, and in reality the range was a fair bit less than that most of the time.

It's a known fault with the car discussed on the Facebook car owners forum at some length.

"
1267,91962,idiotzoo,Reduced Range,"
The indicated range is a fiction. The max range is essentially the usable battery capacity multiplied by the car’s supposed efficiency. So if you can achieve 4 miles/kWh and have a 42kWh battery with 37.3kWh usable, then the range is 149 miles.

4 miles/kWh is pretty good this time of year and you probably won’t manage that. 3.5 is more realistic, so the range is then 130.

to get 199 miles from 37.3 kWh usable means hitting over 5 miles/kWh which is… optimistic. Then again it’s a city car by design so in summer, with very careful driving, you might manage it.

More realistic is just 4.3miles/kWh which gives you the 161 range.

The more I think about it, have they massively cocked up and stated the car’s range based on the full battery capacity rather than the usable capacity?
 
"
1268,95742,Smitten,Reduced Range,"
You need a purpose built EV with a slippery outside shape like a model 3 to exceed 4 miles/kWh in winter. Our e208 is giving about 3.3 m/kWh now and it has a 45kW battery. So 199 miles is fantasy from a 37kW battery. Most we have had in the summer is 170 miles of actual driving (150 motorway plus 20 left at journeys end). Which brings me to my second point, you don't drive the car from full to empty. You probably start with 80% or so and end up with 10 to 15% so your range is already reduced.
 
"
1269,1604,Lexden,Reduced Range,"
In many EVs, range in cold weather can be maximised if the cabin and battery are pre-conditioned before departure whilst the car is still connected to an EVSE. As stated above, damp roads and the use of heating; lighting and wipers are a constant battery drain. Cold weather range reduction of 25% is not uncommon in some wet and cold wintry conditions. I have also had days when the GOM range has dropped quickly post departure, only to stabilise and increase as cabin temperature stabilises.

"
1272,104462,AustinM64,Reduced Range,"Ah, interesting; that explains a lot. I went to Brighton yesterday which for me was about 85 miles. If I couldn't get a charging point I planned a 20 min top-up at Cobham Services on the M25. As 90% of my journey was on the motorway, and they were clear, I spent the majority of that time at 70 mph. The 85-mile journey took nearly 140 miles off the 'range'. In the time I was there, I charged the car back to 85%. On the journey back I stayed at 60 mph and this time the 85-mile journey consumed approximately 105 miles of 'range'. 

I drove these journeys in the 'Range Mode' which did help. I note that in 'Sherpa Mode' the car asks you to limit the speed to 50 mph.

It's a learning curve I guess ......but it is still a great car!

"
1274,50,Paul_Moxhay,Reduced Range,"The indicated range on any EV is only ever an estimate but with most it is an educated estimate in that it adjusts the indicated range based on how the car was driven over the recent past. Many of us call it a ""guestimate"" and the range indicator we often call the ""Guess'o'Meter"" or GoM  Drive the car hard then not only will you get less actual range but from then on the car will assume that it will be driven hard and the estimate will be lower. Drive the car gently for a period and the car assumes more gentle driving for the future and so the estimate will go up. 

Also... the faster you drive the less range you will get so you seeing a drop in indicated range reduction when you drove slower is to be expected.
 
"
1275,75416,,Reduced Range,"
That was the very best figure, though. Even under optimum conditions there was a ~9% range shortfall compared with the spec. In winter the range was only about 76% of the specification figure, so about a 24% shortfall.

That's comparable with some EVs. My car has a spec that gives a WLTP range of 292 miles, in reality is does around 270 miles in ideal conditions (an 8% shortfall versus the spec) and about 210 miles in worst case conditions (a 28% shortfall versus the spec). This isn't wildly different to the ICE car variation, is it?

The peculiar thing about the 500 is that once fully charged it always claims a range of 161.6 (don't forget the .6!) miles.

Fiat say take it to a dealer to they can pull the logs, and won't investigate otherwise. It would be good to know if this is a widespread problem. Its fairly high on the nuisance list since we rely on being able to charge different cars on different days and have an off-peak tariff.

Dumb question, how are you charging it? Is this with the granny charger? If so I’d expect it to be at the lowest level - those things are slow, not usually going over 10A
if it’s with the wall charger, do you have 7.2kw/32A (or 3.6kw/16A)
But as @TRC7 not sure why you wouldn’t always set it to “5” 

perhaps someone else will be able to be more help 🤷‍♂️

@Mofo thanks. I guess to ask my question another way (and apologies if I’m taking the thread off on a tangent), is there any benefit to charging more slowly, if you don’t need a quick charge? I always thought the charge speed was determined by the power output of the charger (and size of the battery). Here, Fiat seem to be giving you an option to vary the charge speed within a particular power output, but don’t seem to explain why you would want to do that.
 
"
1282,98020,Cinquecento,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
My seems to default to Level 3 , so when scheduling the charge , I just confirm to Level 5 . I need the Level 5 so as to charge at 7KW in my 4 hour window of cheap rate ( 5p per KW with Octopus Go ).
 
"
1283,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"Charging more slowly can be kinder to the battery, but to a point…
rapid charging (50+kw) most damaging but can still be done many times
but the charging you do at home/destinations (7kW 32A) doesn’t make much difference, the lower settings are there for people with restrictions, such as 60A home fuse, so not enough capacity to have a full 7kW 32A, instead they’ve got 3.6kW 16A outlet, or others only have a 13A socket, so use the granny charger, these are limited to 10A (but could be put down to 6A, if you have the settings/need to), to protect the wiring/socket/connection as you don’t usually have something at 13A running full chat for maybe 12hrs, causing any weakness to overheat & possibly set fire
Though the lower Amps you charge at, the less efficient the charging is, so that’ll cost more, but this is only a tiny amount
hoping that makes some sort of sense 🙂

Two reasons to charge slowly for me. I can get 6 or 8 A 'free' on a clear day from my solar panels, and if I need to use an extension on my Tesla granny charger, I end up using the 16A adaptor rather than the 13A socket, so I need to set 3/5 to get a comfortable 10A (I have a europe friendly set of adaptors and extensions).
 
"

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged.

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged.

Hi all 
I’m a first time car owner and got myself the Fiat 500e. 
I really love it but everything being so tight in London and me not being the best at parking I scratched badly my wheel today. You can imagine how gutted I was for my brand new car 

So I wanted to ask - do you normally fix yours as soon as damaged?
Shall I take it where I bought it from to fix or just find someone locally to repair? 
Is there any type of protection I can add to avoid dents and scratches?
Thanks

If they're standard silver wheels (not fancy diamond cut faces) then maybe a cheap touch up pen from the likes of Halfords can make them look a little less damaged...

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1417,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1418,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1455,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1456,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

That appears to be the price for the ""loaded"" first editions (which is another general trend for car launches), they seem to be targeting a £21-25k figure for the regular models (including the £3k grant).

We are looking at a car for my wife, and it was between the Mini e and the Honda e, but I think we will wait and look at the Fiat 500 e convertible, she already has a Mini convertible. Once the lower costs are revealed, then I cannot see why if you are after a small car, you would choose the more expensive, shorter range cars (Mini and Honda e)

The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

1584,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

"
1587,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1588,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1589,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.
 
"
1590,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

1593,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"So if it's just supplied within a box in the boot, it does appear that it's a case of like it or lump it. In which case the advice to just replace the cable with a longer one seems ok. Viridian is a decent company to deal with. If you are confident that you can isolate the supply to the Wallbox, this is probably a DIY job, not much different to changing a plug.
 
"
1594,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Who installed the EASY WALLBOX. Is it wired up to deliver 7kW. Did the installer check that it worked, with a simulation box, on an actual EV?
 
"

It may be 'penny pinching', I am quite sure it is frustrating, but it is what FIAT supply and if it doesn't suit your particular situation, I think that is just unfortunate.
 
"
1596,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"The reason I ask is if you modify the charger by swooping the cable, you probably will have lost any warranty rights. So did the installer actually check that the Easy Wallbox actually works. Did they give you any paperwork to record the same.
How do you know the installation is compliant with wiring regs? Has the DNO been informed?

"
1601,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
1602,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1624,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1625,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose

"
1709,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

It looks to me that to be accepted onto the JustPark 'grant' scheme you'll need to agree to permit other drivers to use your charge point.

I'd read the t's and c's very carefully and make sure you understand precisely what is being offered here.

We're loving ours so far - we went for the Passion (cheapest convertible!) and it's now our only car so we'll be putting FIAT's range claims to the test. One thing I can say is that they aren't good for the shy - especially when they start singing at about 12mph!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun.

A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout!
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).
 
"
1798,5634,Biffa,Thinking about shipping our 2013 Fiat 500e to the UK - am I nuts? (Oops - posting this again in the correct forum),"
When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.

So for an extra 20k you can have much improved..... I am assuming range, how much would that be per mile of additional and possibly un needed city car range.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Type approval, individual (IVA), motorcycle single vehicle approval, voluntary approval, certificate of initial fitness, accessibility approval, fees, forms, replacement certificates

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

Hi

Anyone who has picked up their new cars, how is the app and software ? This is usually the main issue with new EVs (see ID.3) 
Can you pre-condition, can you see where the car is etc..
 
"
1831,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Not connected the app yet, but I've noticed that the current firmware (FCA_R1L_ARM64_00.26.21.12.00 on the head unit) has messed up menus for Safety and driving assistance (all the intermediate menu labels are blank). If you click through, the functions underneath seem to work.
From in the car, you can set 3 schedules for charging and climate, and it seems independently set the charge rate in 5 stages. I'll look at charging tomorrow since I have weekend off-peak.
 
"
1832,96388,Pimpernello,Software,"
We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.

As to battery percentage and range , I wonder whether previous driving styles/modes are taken into consideration in the calculation of range.

Great car and opted for the electric sunroof, which is great to have.

Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored.

Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.

Have a look at page 204 & 205 of the owners Manual. I haven't tried this yet, and not sure if my interpretation is correct .Next time I have the car in the garage , I will experiment. I to have scheduled charging set for my Octopus Go low rate :
When the charging cable is inserted and there are no charging schedules selected, the cable will be locked and the immediate charging procedure will begin. LED (B) fig. 212 and LEDs (B) fig. 211 will light up green flashing/fixed depending on the state of charge of the battery portion indicated by the LED. The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.
To switch to immediate charging mode during scheduled charging:
if charging is in progress, interrupt the scheduled charging first (see chapter ""Interrupting charging"");
activate immediate recharging by pressing the button again (A) fig. 212 on the port.

tsh2, I plugged in this morning, and vehicle recognised the scheduled time (00:30 - 04:30). I pressed the Black (Sealed button below the lights) in the charging port and vehicle started charging overriding the schedule. I hope this assists.
 
"
1838,97958,tsh2,Software,"Yss, I managed to get to the manual last night. It seems that the button toggles between Charge/Schedule/Stop in some way which is (to me) badly described in the manual. One of the few cases where a flowchart would make sense, I think.

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too). Finally, my chromebook did open the QR code link and allow me to save the document. Direct link (hosted by Fiat, not bypassing any access control) is below.
00_332_NUOVA500_603.85.345_EN_01_03.21_L_LG.pdf (fiat.com)

I note that all the lights on the charge port go off whilst it is waiting to charge (which makes sense, I would expect the car to be in a sleep state).
 
"
1839,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Quick update on the app. After waiting for a week, support in Italy confirmed that the email address which the system was expecting wasn't the one we had provided. After this was updated, we needed to re-register.

App and website are now available, but the feature set seems not what they expect. Still in contact with them, seems like they need someone with a car to debug. No charge, battery or range info at the moment. Can't set speed or ringfence alerts either.

Does anyone know of the car supports over the air (OTA) updates?
 
"
1841,97958,tsh2,Software,"According to the manual, yes. It will connect to WiFi, but I've not checked if it is doing anything (there is no indication). The manual also says free cellular download if WiFi is not connected.

Did you ever get the battery info etc ... on the app ? i am in the same boat as you ....
 
"
1844,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Yes, it eventually got sorted. Wasn't clear if it was a a vehicle specific issue or general. Probably best to follow up with Fiat assist directly - their software story is certainly a bit lagging.

One thing to be aware of is the charge state isn't quite real-time, so you can't always rely on it to show how fast the car is charging.

I have also just collected my Passion, so I feel your pain because I had the same issue.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

However, I have not got tyre pressures either. Not sure how to resolve that one.

1848,98903,LaserTam,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"It seems there have been a fair few issues with the software on these cars. Nothing I've heard actually stops you being able to use it, but are just a bit of an inconvenience/annoying.
 
"
1849,98020,Cinquecento,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"
I empathise . Had similar issues . My dealer was useless and I turned to Fiat Customer Services for issues . Yes software problems do continue . eg. I frequently have to to reset the radio to get the live traffic information to show on the navigation system. 
I love the car and using more than I expected as this is our town car. Usually charge at home on Octopus Go , but do use free chargers at retail centres where/when available.

I have found many things which aren't in the so called handbook. The vehicle has been plagued with issues so it's more than likely Iv'e come across most of the problems that are thrown up .

1858,105572,Bedworth147,Fiat 500e 2021 (Passion),"Hi, I am looking to swap the wifes car from a kia picanto to the fiat 500 electric Red edition. I am used to electric as i have had an Ipace for the last year. Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.
Cheers if you can assist.

1863,105197,Mark25810,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Hi there 

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks
 
"
1864,98903,LaserTam,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.

1873,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
1881,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

1883,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.
 
"
1885,247,Charlie S,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now 
 
"
1886,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
1899,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

1904,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.
 
"
1910,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1914,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1915,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

1916,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
1928,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

I don’t know what a granny lead is but as it comes with the car and is badged as a 500e as shown in the picture I would expect it to work as a proper charge point. I am happy to get it installed and connected up by a proper installation firm but cannot see how whatever they do makes it reasonable to supply it with such a mean cable length. The pod point my Leaf runs off is a much more solid and practical piece of kit and I hope Fiat or Easy Wallbox. Will up their game in future.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.
 
"
1946,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

"
1949,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
1950,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
1951,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh.

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

Going to sound silly but what does it come with. 

The salesman has said we get;


Type 2 cable (3 pin)

Now my previous BMW i3 came with two cables but the Rolec was part of a government grant. 

Can anyone shed any light on this?

I hope this helps anyone with similar issues . The software was updated prior to delivery and all was required was a restart of the radio on the U-Connect system .Shame the dealer didn't do this or even know to do it. Please see below from Fiat Customer Services. It worked for me after 3 resets of the ""radio restart "" . I now have live traffic information showing on the Maps. I had a phone call from Italy and the process was talked through. They sent the below by mail confirming the process. 


Thank you for contacting Fiat.

Following your recent enquiry and as discussed with the customer care agent over the phone, we recommend completing the operations below:

Ensure that you are in an area that has a good internet coverage, proceed with a radio restart followed by a key cycle: from the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Radio restart.
Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

Should you continue to experience any issues, repeat the radio restart + key cycle up to 3-4 times.

If this still does not work, then try with a further Factory reset: rom the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Factory settings.

Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on.

Please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Relations team from Monday to Friday between 09:00 and 18:00 on 00800 3428 0000, choosing option number 2.

Yours sincerely,

Marco Verpilio

Ah this is good news. Our 500e will probably have to have a visit to the dealer soon as it keeps reverting to KMH and reseting the schedules, which is a tad annoying, so I’ll ask them to look at this at the same time.

Apologies if I've missed a thread on this, but I couldn't find one.

The new Fiat 500e has been revealed and to me it looks like a very appealing prospect. Good looks, a much better interior than the current 500 and decent specs (including a 42kWh battery).

That appears to be the price for the ""loaded"" first editions (which is another general trend for car launches), they seem to be targeting a £21-25k figure for the regular models (including the £3k grant).
 
"

We are looking at a car for my wife, and it was between the Mini e and the Honda e, but I think we will wait and look at the Fiat 500 e convertible, she already has a Mini convertible. Once the lower costs are revealed, then I cannot see why if you are after a small car, you would choose the more expensive, shorter range cars (Mini and Honda e)

The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE.

2078,105197,Mark25810,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
Someone just told me for the pre-conditioniong to work from the app you have to make sure when you leave the car that the heating is turned on lol
 
"
2079,102687,Koda,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
Depends on your car. 
-Some will run at the last temperature that you set inside the car. 
-Some will let you set the temperature in the app or vehicle settings. 
-Some will always precondition to a fixed temperature. Say 19 Degrees.

I’m not familiar with the Fiat EVs so will leave it for another person to explain how it works for you, but what you’ve been told by someone may well be true in their specific car.
 
"
2080,98903,LaserTam,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
I have never tried it on my 500e but I have read that the pre-con uses the temp you last set, I.e 20deg. I don't know if you have to have the heater switched on though.
 
"
2081,93356,whyone,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
We always leave the heating on, so I don't know the answer to your question.

However, it wouldn't surprise me at all - functionality from the Fiat app is rudimentary. For 'climate' there is no option to set temperature and you can't turn the pre-heating off from the app.
 
"
2082,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.

We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
2090,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.

Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now 
 
"
2095,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

2096,25425,Mickeypeach,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.
 
"
2097,5306,srichards,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.
 
"
2098,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.
 
"
2099,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

2100,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.
 
"
2101,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

2103,100409,Jjr,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"I looked on wallbox site and can’t see one with 2 metre lead they look all to be 5 metres so somethings no right, did it state anything on your order .?
 
"
2104,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
2105,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
2106,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.
 
"
2107,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

2118,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
2119,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box.

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
2123,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

"
2127,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

A silly question but if I plug this into the normal mains socket and into the car ...and not use the timer on the cable itself does it actually start charging right away or do you have to activate it via the car or cars app. Asking because it would be handy to set the timer via the app or car for a granny cable incase you have one without built in timer.

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.

2149,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right? Speak to your local qualified electrician. You can get fixed up a lot cheaper than you might think. 7kw will charge the 500 overnight with ease. A granny charger twice as long.

2154,105197,Mark25810,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Hi there 

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks
 
"
2155,98903,LaserTam,What charging cables come with the fiat 500e icon?,"
Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.

2159,98903,LaserTam,500e discounts available?,"
Hi all, just joined the forum.
Following a sucessfull test drive, we are very keen to place an order on a Passion in Celestial Blue. The dealership have not been particularly great, so I do not have any loyalty, so would be willing to search around for a better deal than list price. 

Has anyone been successful in achieving an order under list price (less the UK government grant and fiat deposit contribution). Carwow is mostly coming back with list price, with one exception but delivery charges from so far away eat into any discount.

Thanks

They’ll all do PCP offers with deposit contribution at some point. You’re always free to take the offer then phone up and settle it straight away.
 
"
2161,98903,LaserTam,500e discounts available?,"Thanks.
Yes, I am being offered the deposit contribution as I am financing this via PCP. But any deal is based on the price of the car. I have spoken to another dealer and they are saying no chance of any list price discounts because the model is so new. Only room to maneuver would be the trade in value of my current car. I'm waiting to hear back from them on that.
 
"

Yeah you’ll need to wait a while until there’s loads of stock and some manufacturer offers. New-to-market EVs never have mad offers as there’s usually only 5 of them on the boat, all assigned to waiting lists already.

In a year or so you’ll most likely get a deal.

Hi

Anyone who has picked up their new cars, how is the app and software ? This is usually the main issue with new EVs (see ID.3) 
Can you pre-condition, can you see where the car is etc..
 
"
2168,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Not connected the app yet, but I've noticed that the current firmware (FCA_R1L_ARM64_00.26.21.12.00 on the head unit) has messed up menus for Safety and driving assistance (all the intermediate menu labels are blank). If you click through, the functions underneath seem to work.
From in the car, you can set 3 schedules for charging and climate, and it seems independently set the charge rate in 5 stages. I'll look at charging tomorrow since I have weekend off-peak.
 
"
2169,96388,Pimpernello,Software,"
We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.
 
"
2170,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
Collected my La Prima 3 weeks ago. It had recall Software updates installed prior to delivery, which delayed collection. I am still familiarising myself, but car is going back in hopefully for Nav update and others as Traffic Information and Tyre Pressures do not show. I can't be sure everything else is working at this stage. As to battery percentage and range , I wonder whether previous driving styles/modes are taken into consideration in the calculation of range.

Great car and opted for the electric sunroof, which is great to have.

2171,96388,Pimpernello,Software,"Yes.
Sunroof and winter pack extras here also. Ocean Green. Fantastic.
 
"
2172,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored.

Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.
 
"
2173,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
Have a look at page 204 & 205 of the owners Manual. I haven't tried this yet, and not sure if my interpretation is correct .Next time I have the car in the garage , I will experiment. I to have scheduled charging set for my Octopus Go low rate :
When the charging cable is inserted and there are no charging schedules selected, the cable will be locked and the immediate charging procedure will begin. LED (B) fig. 212 and LEDs (B) fig. 211 will light up green flashing/fixed depending on the state of charge of the battery portion indicated by the LED. The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.
To switch to immediate charging mode during scheduled charging:
if charging is in progress, interrupt the scheduled charging first (see chapter ""Interrupting charging"");
activate immediate recharging by pressing the button again (A) fig. 212 on the port.
 
"
2174,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
tsh2, I plugged in this morning, and vehicle recognised the scheduled time (00:30 - 04:30). I pressed the Black (Sealed button below the lights) in the charging port and vehicle started charging overriding the schedule. I hope this assists.
 
"
2175,97958,tsh2,Software,"Yss, I managed to get to the manual last night. It seems that the button toggles between Charge/Schedule/Stop in some way which is (to me) badly described in the manual. One of the few cases where a flowchart would make sense, I think.

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too). Finally, my chromebook did open the QR code link and allow me to save the document. Direct link (hosted by Fiat, not bypassing any access control) is below.

I note that all the lights on the charge port go off whilst it is waiting to charge (which makes sense, I would expect the car to be in a sleep state).
 
"
2176,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Quick update on the app. After waiting for a week, support in Italy confirmed that the email address which the system was expecting wasn't the one we had provided. After this was updated, we needed to re-register.

App and website are now available, but the feature set seems not what they expect. Still in contact with them, seems like they need someone with a car to debug. No charge, battery or range info at the moment. Can't set speed or ringfence alerts either.

Yes, it eventually got sorted. Wasn't clear if it was a a vehicle specific issue or general. Probably best to follow up with Fiat assist directly - their software story is certainly a bit lagging.

One thing to be aware of is the charge state isn't quite real-time, so you can't always rely on it to show how fast the car is charging.
 
"
2182,105197,Mark25810,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
Someone just told me for the pre-conditioniong to work from the app you have to make sure when you leave the car that the heating is turned on lol
 
"
2183,102687,Koda,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
Depends on your car. 
-Some will run at the last temperature that you set inside the car. 
-Some will let you set the temperature in the app or vehicle settings. 
-Some will always precondition to a fixed temperature. Say 19 Degrees.

I’m not familiar with the Fiat EVs so will leave it for another person to explain how it works for you, but what you’ve been told by someone may well be true in their specific car.
 
"
2184,98903,LaserTam,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
I have never tried it on my 500e but I have read that the pre-con uses the temp you last set, I.e 20deg. I don't know if you have to have the heater switched on though.
 
"
2185,93356,whyone,Is it right about the pre-condition,"
We always leave the heating on, so I don't know the answer to your question.

However, it wouldn't surprise me at all - functionality from the Fiat app is rudimentary. For 'climate' there is no option to set temperature and you can't turn the pre-heating off from the app.

2202,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
2210,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

"
2215,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

2218,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

Hi,
We are close to ordering a new fiat 500e, but I am interested in the service intervals and cost. The dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles..? Is this correct for an electric car.? Surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts.?
If anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated.

I've contacted my local dealer (not the one supplying ) and they said they didn't have any details on frequency nor cost ....... There's cars being driven I find it pretty unacceptable tbh. 

They said 'ah well - the cars probably won't need servicing for 12 months so we've got plenty of time'.......

Also we're picking ours up in September. We didn't get offered the servicing package. Is that a fiat wide offer or something the dealer can elect to provide?
 
"
2223,78496,dsaunders70,Fiat 500e service intervals,"
I spoke to the dealer again when we placed our order yesterday... and they confirmed service is every 12 months...! This is ridiculous, my Skoda enyaq is every 24 months...!

There is an offer for fixed price servicing of £299 for 3 years... I think this is only available if using PCP finance..

"
2228,3040,Hilltop Dave,Fiat 500e service intervals,"
Because most EV's have regenerative braking (to put energy back into the battery when slowing down or going downhill), the friction brakes do not get as much regular use as with ICE cars, so brake discs can get rusty through little use.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
2235,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
2236,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.
 
"
2237,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

"
2259,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

This seems to be the original description of the Easy Wallbox, before someone in the UK decided to re-interpret it (my highlight of the relevant text):

""Easy Wallbox™ is installed with two wall plugs, easily connects to the electricity grid and means you can recharge the car’s batteries without exceeding your power contract or regulatory limits. In addition, with an electrician only needing to perform a non-invasive intervention, the device uses only the power available in your home in real-time, avoiding any risk of blackouts. ""

I don’t know what a granny lead is but as it comes with the car and is badged as a 500e as shown in the picture I would expect it to work as a proper charge point. I am happy to get it installed and connected up by a proper installation firm but cannot see how whatever they do makes it reasonable to supply it with such a mean cable length. The pod point my Leaf runs off is a much more solid and practical piece of kit and I hope Fiat or Easy Wallbox. Will up their game in future.

2266,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"
Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

2268,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"Thanks, that was another thing that put us off the Zoe unfortunately! We looked at the PSA range (Corsa e, 208 etc) but they just feel a bit big for what we need. I don’t know what Renault were thinking, they have a crazy good formula with the Zoe for price vs range/spec… then throwing it away for the sake of a few safety features, mind blowing! Really like the styling of the 500e thou… just the kids are the concern before we commit.

We need to book a test drive really but it’s such a faff aligning schedules etc
 
"
2269,103587,,Kids in the backseat,"Well the current small hatchbacks on sale you have these three using the same platform just a different shell:

Peugeot e-208 / Citroen e-C4 / Corsa-e

These two:

The Renault Zoe / Nissan LEAF 🙈

The only two I'd suggest, the Born making the ID.3 look like plain porridge.

ID.3 / Cupra Born ✅

Then the small segment:

The Fiat which I think looks ace:

Fiat 500e ✅

The only thing coming soon to trump it is the Ora Cat.

I’m afraid I can’t help about kids and booster seats, but the dealership’s salesman (fully grown man, if not particularly tall) was sitting behind me (also not exactly a basketball player… I’m 5’7”) during our 500 test drive, and he could fit 🤷‍♂️

We have grandkids in the back of ours, for fairly short trips. Age ranges from 14, down to 5. They come. Might struggle if I was driving as seat has to go almost all the way back.
 
"
2273,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"Thanks! These would be 10-15 miles really at most as it’s just running round town. My other half is about 5’6 so she’s not right back with the seat, although tbf the 5 year old would prob be behind the 12 year old in the passenger seat

I have a 500e icon and we have a 9 and 6 yea old and it’s completely fine no issues. We have a high back booster and a sit on booster and it works well, plenty of space for them. I’m 5ft 8 and they have leg room. We use ours for short and long journeys. It’s a great car

2276,93356,whyone,Kids in the backseat,"
We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR)

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.
 
"
2277,86600,D57,Kids in the backseat,"
I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e...

I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching.
I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK.
The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

 
"
2278,84029,hrp123,Kids in the backseat,"
Two kids aged 9 and 7 with backless boosters working fine so far. Only issue is they find it hard pushing the seatbelt into the buckle - which is at an angle - I am inserting something under it to try and stop the buckles falling back in the holders.
 
"
2279,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.
 
"
2280,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

"
2283,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
2284,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
2285,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.
 
"
2286,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

"
2297,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
2298,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

We didn't get one of these with our 'Red Edition' car but reading on the FIAT website, it appears that it 'eliminates the possibility of a powercut'!

Impressive.

""The easyWallbox is a Bluetooth “Plug&Play” solution. All you need is a power outlet. Attach the easyWallbox to a wall, and plug it in like any home appliance, using the UK 3 pin plug. It has a standard charging power of 2.3 kW, but with the help of an electrician, it can be professionally installed and increased to 7.4 kW, which will enable you to charge up to 80% of full capacity in less than 4 hours. It can also regulate the charging power autonomously and safely, delivering the maximum power available in your home, whilst eliminating the possibility of a powercut. ""

"
2308,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.
 
"
2309,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
This seems to be the original description of the Easy Wallbox, before someone in the UK decided to re-interpret it (my highlight of the relevant text):

""Easy Wallbox™ is installed with two wall plugs, easily connects to the electricity grid and means you can recharge the car’s batteries without exceeding your power contract or regulatory limits. In addition, with an electrician only needing to perform a non-invasive intervention, the device uses only the power available in your home in real-time, avoiding any risk of blackouts. ""

2311,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I don’t know what a granny lead is but as it comes with the car and is badged as a 500e as shown in the picture I would expect it to work as a proper charge point. I am happy to get it installed and connected up by a proper installation firm but cannot see how whatever they do makes it reasonable to supply it with such a mean cable length. The pod point my Leaf runs off is a much more solid and practical piece of kit and I hope Fiat or Easy Wallbox. Will up their game in future.
 
"
2312,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It is unusually short and would seem to be penny pinching, particularly as the location of the charge port on the rear wing means that parking tail in might block the boot.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

We didn't get one of these with our 'Red Edition' car but reading on the FIAT website, it appears that it 'eliminates the possibility of a powercut'!

Impressive.

""The easyWallbox is a Bluetooth “Plug&Play” solution. All you need is a power outlet. Attach the easyWallbox to a wall, and plug it in like any home appliance, using the UK 3 pin plug. It has a standard charging power of 2.3 kW, but with the help of an electrician, it can be professionally installed and increased to 7.4 kW, which will enable you to charge up to 80% of full capacity in less than 4 hours. It can also regulate the charging power autonomously and safely, delivering the maximum power available in your home, whilst eliminating the possibility of a powercut. ""

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

This seems to be the original description of the Easy Wallbox, before someone in the UK decided to re-interpret it (my highlight of the relevant text):

""Easy Wallbox™ is installed with two wall plugs, easily connects to the electricity grid and means you can recharge the car’s batteries without exceeding your power contract or regulatory limits. In addition, with an electrician only needing to perform a non-invasive intervention, the device uses only the power available in your home in real-time, avoiding any risk of blackouts. ""

I don’t know what a granny lead is but as it comes with the car and is badged as a 500e as shown in the picture I would expect it to work as a proper charge point. I am happy to get it installed and connected up by a proper installation firm but cannot see how whatever they do makes it reasonable to supply it with such a mean cable length. The pod point my Leaf runs off is a much more solid and practical piece of kit and I hope Fiat or Easy Wallbox. Will up their game in future.

2359,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
2367,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"

"
2372,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

"
2375,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.

2378,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
2382,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
2383,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.

Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.

We didn't get one of these with our 'Red Edition' car but reading on the FIAT website, it appears that it 'eliminates the possibility of a powercut'!

Impressive.

""The easyWallbox is a Bluetooth “Plug&Play” solution. All you need is a power outlet. Attach the easyWallbox to a wall, and plug it in like any home appliance, using the UK 3 pin plug. It has a standard charging power of 2.3 kW, but with the help of an electrician, it can be professionally installed and increased to 7.4 kW, which will enable you to charge up to 80% of full capacity in less than 4 hours. It can also regulate the charging power autonomously and safely, delivering the maximum power available in your home, whilst eliminating the possibility of a powercut. ""

Just very badly translated, I think. This charge point is advertised in countries in Europe that have load limiting trip switches on their incoming supply, like France and, I believe, Spain, as reducing the risk of blackouts, not as a way of providing power during them.

These load limiting trip switches are a pretty standard arrangement in parts of Europe, where the consumer can choose to pay a higher tariff in order to be able to draw more current from the supply. The original Italian advert makes it clear that the ""prevention of blackouts"" feature is just load limiting, so the charge point can be set to not allow the current drawn by the charger in the car to exceed the set supply trip current limit. Resetting the Italian equivalent of the French household interrupteur différentiel after it's blacked the house out because too much current has been drawn is a nuisance, one that this thing is designed to reduce.

This seems to be the original description of the Easy Wallbox, before someone in the UK decided to re-interpret it (my highlight of the relevant text):

""Easy Wallbox™ is installed with two wall plugs, easily connects to the electricity grid and means you can recharge the car’s batteries without exceeding your power contract or regulatory limits. In addition, with an electrician only needing to perform a non-invasive intervention, the device uses only the power available in your home in real-time, avoiding any risk of blackouts. ""

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now!

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

Id go Fiat 500e or ID.3 if the back seats aren't big enough.









Its not that much more than the Zoe, basically like a Golf.

I’m afraid I can’t help about kids and booster seats, but the dealership’s salesman (fully grown man, if not particularly tall) was sitting behind me (also not exactly a basketball player… I’m 5’7”) during our 500 test drive, and he could fit 🤷‍♂️

We have grandkids in the back of ours, for fairly short trips. Age ranges from 14, down to 5. They come. Might struggle if I was driving as seat has to go almost all the way back.
 
"
2525,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"Thanks! These would be 10-15 miles really at most as it’s just running round town. My other half is about 5’6 so she’s not right back with the seat, although tbf the 5 year old would prob be behind the 12 year old in the passenger seat

I have a 500e icon and we have a 9 and 6 yea old and it’s completely fine no issues. We have a high back booster and a sit on booster and it works well, plenty of space for them. I’m 5ft 8 and they have leg room. We use ours for short and long journeys. It’s a great car

We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR)

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.

I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e...

I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching.
I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK.
The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

"
2533,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"Thanks, that was another thing that put us off the Zoe unfortunately! We looked at the PSA range (Corsa e, 208 etc) but they just feel a bit big for what we need. I don’t know what Renault were thinking, they have a crazy good formula with the Zoe for price vs range/spec… then throwing it away for the sake of a few safety features, mind blowing! Really like the styling of the 500e thou… just the kids are the concern before we commit.

We need to book a test drive really but it’s such a faff aligning schedules etc
 
"
2534,103587,,Kids in the backseat,"Well the current small hatchbacks on sale you have these three using the same platform just a different shell:

Peugeot e-208 / Citroen e-C4 / Corsa-e

These two:

The Renault Zoe / Nissan LEAF 🙈

The only two I'd suggest, the Born making the ID.3 look like plain porridge.

ID.3 / Cupra Born ✅

Then the small segment:

The Fiat which I think looks ace:

Fiat 500e ✅

The only thing coming soon to trump it is the Ora Cat.

The cable is only 2 metres long, this is too short to plug into the car, Fiat and Wallbox have not been able to offer any solutions after six weeks of using my Nissan Leaf’s charger. Surely they could make a 4.5 metre cable as standard length.
 
"
2545,84466,dk6780,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
The specification says 3m rather than 2m. But it is clearly not fit for purpose and has either been installed in the wrong place or needs a longer cable. There are plenty of longer cables available secondhand that you could buy and fit for around £50, or you can fight them and I'm sure that they are cable of providing a longer one or moving the box.

"
2547,100409,Jjr,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"I looked on wallbox site and can’t see one with 2 metre lead they look all to be 5 metres so somethings no right, did it state anything on your order .?
 
"
2548,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I was mistaken, it is actually 3metres long but even when fastened on the most forward spot on our wall it is 10cm too short to plug into the car. 5 metres would be perfect, I am glad to hear the cable can be swapped but I feel Fiat or Arnold Clark should fund it as I bought the top of the range model at nearly £30000 it should supply a charger fit for purpose
 
"
2549,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Thanks. How much would it cost for a 5metre cable? Could it be supplied and fitted as it appears to be a sealed unit and I am no electrician
 
"
2550,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Arnold Clark are that car dealer universally known for great service, NOT.
If you want to get contractual, remember your contract is with the supplying dealer, not FIAT. 
Reread the terms of the contract. Look for terms that say something similar to "" subject to survey"". If Arnold Clark or any if their agents performed the survey they are responsible for delivering a fit for purpose charger, including one with a lead long enough to reach the FIAT's charging port. If Arnold' Clark's agent ( this might be Wallbox) were negligent in their survey and did not measure the distance accurately, they are responsible under the terms of the contract which they signed to make good, I. E. swop for a longer cable.

Now it comes down to how you want to enforce the contract. You are looking at a cost of say £250 parts and £150 labour to replace the charging cable. Instructing a solicitor to write a letter might consume most of that with uncertainty as to whether you would recover all your costs. So get a quote for supply and replacement of a longer cable. Phone up your local trading standards officer and see if they can offer assistance or advice.

Good luck.
 
"
2551,105852,tonyellis56,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
Thanks, that’s helpful. The wallbox comes in a box in the boot of the car with the Fiat 500e so no survey is involved, it just seems an oversight by Fiat and/or the Easy Wallbox Company not to be so penny pinching in not putting a standard cable of reasonable length onto their pre packed charger unit.

2554,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"So if it's just supplied within a box in the boot, it does appear that it's a case of like it or lump it. In which case the advice to just replace the cable with a longer one seems ok. Viridian is a decent company to deal with. If you are confident that you can isolate the supply to the Wallbox, this is probably a DIY job, not much different to changing a plug.
 
"
2555,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"Who installed the EASY WALLBOX. Is it wired up to deliver 7kW. Did the installer check that it worked, with a simulation box, on an actual EV?
 
"

It may be 'penny pinching', I am quite sure it is frustrating, but it is what FIAT supply and if it doesn't suit your particular situation, I think that is just unfortunate.
 
"
2557,41433,freddym,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"The reason I ask is if you modify the charger by swooping the cable, you probably will have lost any warranty rights. So did the installer actually check that the Easy Wallbox actually works. Did they give you any paperwork to record the same.
How do you know the installation is compliant with wiring regs? Has the DNO been informed?

"
2562,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
I think we may all have been mislead a bit. What the OP is now describing is not a proper charge point from the sound of things, but the ""get out of jail"" portable charge point, a.k.a the granny lead, to be used when there is no other option for charging available.

I think there may well have been some wires crossed somewhere (metaphorically speaking) and there is no installed EVSE at all. The OP really needs to get a proper charge point installed, and can then be sure that it's installed in the right location so that the cable will reach OK.
 
"
2563,75416,,Easy wallbox cable only 3 metres long-10cm too short,"
It looks to be a granny lead that can be fixed to the wall, really a pretty unsafe and impractical bit of kit from the look of it, and not a properly protected installed charge point at all:

Hi

Anyone who has picked up their new cars, how is the app and software ? This is usually the main issue with new EVs (see ID.3) 
Can you pre-condition, can you see where the car is etc..
 
"
2565,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Not connected the app yet, but I've noticed that the current firmware (FCA_R1L_ARM64_00.26.21.12.00 on the head unit) has messed up menus for Safety and driving assistance (all the intermediate menu labels are blank). If you click through, the functions underneath seem to work.
From in the car, you can set 3 schedules for charging and climate, and it seems independently set the charge rate in 5 stages. I'll look at charging tomorrow since I have weekend off-peak.
 
"
2566,96388,Pimpernello,Software,"
We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.

Collected my La Prima 3 weeks ago. It had recall Software updates installed prior to delivery, which delayed collection. I am still familiarising myself, but car is going back in hopefully for Nav update and others as Traffic Information and Tyre Pressures do not show. I can't be sure everything else is working at this stage. As to battery percentage and range , I wonder whether previous driving styles/modes are taken into consideration in the calculation of range.

Great car and opted for the electric sunroof, which is great to have.

Sunroof and winter pack extras here also. Ocean Green. Fantastic.
 
"
2569,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored.

Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.
 
"
2570,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
Have a look at page 204 & 205 of the owners Manual. I haven't tried this yet, and not sure if my interpretation is correct .Next time I have the car in the garage , I will experiment. I to have scheduled charging set for my Octopus Go low rate :
When the charging cable is inserted and there are no charging schedules selected, the cable will be locked and the immediate charging procedure will begin. LED (B) fig. 212 and LEDs (B) fig. 211 will light up green flashing/fixed depending on the state of charge of the battery portion indicated by the LED. The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.
To switch to immediate charging mode during scheduled charging:
if charging is in progress, interrupt the scheduled charging first (see chapter ""Interrupting charging"");
activate immediate recharging by pressing the button again (A) fig. 212 on the port.
 
"
2571,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
tsh2, I plugged in this morning, and vehicle recognised the scheduled time (00:30 - 04:30). I pressed the Black (Sealed button below the lights) in the charging port and vehicle started charging overriding the schedule. I hope this assists.
 
"
2572,97958,tsh2,Software,"Yss, I managed to get to the manual last night. It seems that the button toggles between Charge/Schedule/Stop in some way which is (to me) badly described in the manual. One of the few cases where a flowchart would make sense, I think.

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too). Finally, my chromebook did open the QR code link and allow me to save the document. Direct link (hosted by Fiat, not bypassing any access control) is below.
00_332_NUOVA500_603.85.345_EN_01_03.21_L_LG.pdf (fiat.com)

I note that all the lights on the charge port go off whilst it is waiting to charge (which makes sense, I would expect the car to be in a sleep state).
 
"
2573,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Quick update on the app. After waiting for a week, support in Italy confirmed that the email address which the system was expecting wasn't the one we had provided. After this was updated, we needed to re-register.

App and website are now available, but the feature set seems not what they expect. Still in contact with them, seems like they need someone with a car to debug. No charge, battery or range info at the moment. Can't set speed or ringfence alerts either.

Yes, it eventually got sorted. Wasn't clear if it was a a vehicle specific issue or general. Probably best to follow up with Fiat assist directly - their software story is certainly a bit lagging.

One thing to be aware of is the charge state isn't quite real-time, so you can't always rely on it to show how fast the car is charging.
 
"
2579,97958,tsh2,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Has anyone else noticed this? I'm using scheduled charging and finding very frequently that the car ends up charging at 6A rather than 30A.













Fiat say take it to a dealer to they can pull the logs, and won't investigate otherwise. It would be good to know if this is a widespread problem. Its fairly high on the nuisance list since we rely on being able to charge different cars on different days and have an off-peak tariff.

2580,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Picked up my new 500 today, so will look out for this issue. Probably a stupid, but related question (dealer couldn’t answer): what charging level should I be using if I’m charging the car once a week…why wouldn’t I always put it on 5? Thanks in advance.
 
"
2581,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
I don’t have a Fiat & have no experience with this…
it looks weird, with no real information on the settings 
Dumb question, how are you charging it? Is this with the granny charger? If so I’d expect it to be at the lowest level - those things are slow, not usually going over 10A
if it’s with the wall charger, do you have 7.2kw/32A (or 3.6kw/16A)
But as @TRC7 not sure why you wouldn’t always set it to “5” 

perhaps someone else will be able to be more help 🤷‍♂️
 
"
2582,3413,Oilymo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Yes we’ve seen this issue, although ours dropped to 3, it’s a known software bug. There are also other items that get changed, looking beep and display units to name two.

Are you on the Facebook Group? You might get a quicker response if you post there.
 
"
2583,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
@Mofo thanks. I guess to ask my question another way (and apologies if I’m taking the thread off on a tangent), is there any benefit to charging more slowly, if you don’t need a quick charge? I always thought the charge speed was determined by the power output of the charger (and size of the battery). Here, Fiat seem to be giving you an option to vary the charge speed within a particular power output, but don’t seem to explain why you would want to do that.
 
"
2584,98020,Cinquecento,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
My seems to default to Level 3 , so when scheduling the charge , I just confirm to Level 5 . I need the Level 5 so as to charge at 7KW in my 4 hour window of cheap rate ( 5p per KW with Octopus Go ).
 
"

Two reasons to charge slowly for me. I can get 6 or 8 A 'free' on a clear day from my solar panels, and if I need to use an extension on my Tesla granny charger, I end up using the 16A adaptor rather than the 13A socket, so I need to set 3/5 to get a comfortable 10A (I have a europe friendly set of adaptors and extensions).
 
"
2588,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"Yes! I used to do this, before I had my charge point put in, that is use the granny set low, so that it equalled out my 4kW solar panels 🙂
 
"
2589,97958,tsh2,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Has anyone else noticed this? I'm using scheduled charging and finding very frequently that the car ends up charging at 6A rather than 30A.













Fiat say take it to a dealer to they can pull the logs, and won't investigate otherwise. It would be good to know if this is a widespread problem. Its fairly high on the nuisance list since we rely on being able to charge different cars on different days and have an off-peak tariff.
 
"
2590,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Picked up my new 500 today, so will look out for this issue. Probably a stupid, but related question (dealer couldn’t answer): what charging level should I be using if I’m charging the car once a week…why wouldn’t I always put it on 5? Thanks in advance.
 
"
2591,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
I don’t have a Fiat & have no experience with this…
it looks weird, with no real information on the settings 
Dumb question, how are you charging it? Is this with the granny charger? If so I’d expect it to be at the lowest level - those things are slow, not usually going over 10A
if it’s with the wall charger, do you have 7.2kw/32A (or 3.6kw/16A)
But as @TRC7 not sure why you wouldn’t always set it to “5” 

perhaps someone else will be able to be more help 🤷‍♂️
 
"
2592,3413,Oilymo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Yes we’ve seen this issue, although ours dropped to 3, it’s a known software bug. There are also other items that get changed, looking beep and display units to name two.

Are you on the Facebook Group? You might get a quicker response if you post there.
 
"
2593,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
@Mofo thanks. I guess to ask my question another way (and apologies if I’m taking the thread off on a tangent), is there any benefit to charging more slowly, if you don’t need a quick charge? I always thought the charge speed was determined by the power output of the charger (and size of the battery). Here, Fiat seem to be giving you an option to vary the charge speed within a particular power output, but don’t seem to explain why you would want to do that.
 
"
2594,98020,Cinquecento,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
My seems to default to Level 3 , so when scheduling the charge , I just confirm to Level 5 . I need the Level 5 so as to charge at 7KW in my 4 hour window of cheap rate ( 5p per KW with Octopus Go ).

Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

We looked at the PSA range (Corsa e, 208 etc) but they just feel a bit big for what we need. I don’t know what Renault were thinking, they have a crazy good formula with the Zoe for price vs range/spec… then throwing it away for the sake of a few safety features, mind blowing! Really like the styling of the 500e thou… just the kids are the concern before we commit.

We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR)

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.
 
"
2610,86600,D57,Kids in the backseat,"
I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e...

I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching.
I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK.
The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

Hi all, just joined the forum.
Following a sucessfull test drive, we are very keen to place an order on a Passion in Celestial Blue. The dealership have not been particularly great, so I do not have any loyalty, so would be willing to search around for a better deal than list price. 

Has anyone been successful in achieving an order under list price (less the UK government grant and fiat deposit contribution). Carwow is mostly coming back with list price, with one exception but delivery charges from so far away eat into any discount.

Thanks

Yes, I am being offered the deposit contribution as I am financing this via PCP. But any deal is based on the price of the car. I have spoken to another dealer and they are saying no chance of any list price discounts because the model is so new. Only room to maneuver would be the trade in value of my current car. I'm waiting to hear back from them on that.

Yeah you’ll need to wait a while until there’s loads of stock and some manufacturer offers. New-to-market EVs never have mad offers as there’s usually only 5 of them on the boat, all assigned to waiting lists already.

Dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 3.12 kWh/mile but costs low combined with a few free PodPoints and overnight tariff works out at 1.8p/mile so overall PCP and running costs favour EV over a new petrol Fiat 500. Basically if you spend over £100/month on petrol and range is enough (160 miles) then 500e should be 1st choice for Fiat fans.

I'm not sure about the electric 500, but the original (new original, not original original) was based on the Panda, which was short narrow and tall. I bought one new in 2005. It had a high driving position, which made best use of the interior space.

Your lucky having a seat height adjustment. I have the Red edition with only the 'four way seats' . Not the optional 'six way seats'. So no height adjustments. 
I wish they'd explained this better when buying. Course if you have the posh versions this probably isn't an issue. Myself being 6ft4 I'd like to lower the seat my wife being 5ft4 has a booster cushion. We manage ok. 
Oh my Foxhound mix dog think 40kg Fat Labrador size. Due to a pressing need to get to the vets whilst I was away from home with the usual Mokka dog taxi . She had to carry Bailey in the 500. He popped in and was really quickly at home on the back seats. We don't use the back at all but at a push it's surprisingly roomy. I spent 25mins this afternoon vacuuming his fur off the seats. Love the dog but how he moults!

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
2653,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

"
2657,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

That's a scary bit of kit, certainly not safe to use here, and has no safety approval at all. It can't have, as you cannot draw 3 kW from a standard BS1363 outlet, the maximum is about 2.3 kW.

2670,15145,.Tom.,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
I asked on another thread about what you get in the car. 

Looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug ( not bad but not ideal) as our dumb Rolec charger is nearly 6 years old I'm thinking of upgrading however there isn't any costs cited and dealership doesn't have details. 

Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me £249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat. Dumb also means the energy providers can't tax use (which Im assuming will be enviable) as it's invisible to them so reluctant to give the Rolec up.

Thoughts?
 
"

I’d stick with the Rolec.

The easywallbox is not that smart it's only bluetooth to the phone app, to start or set a programming schedule and see some stats. I'm thinking of replacing our current charger as it's not tethered. So it should just need the electrician to disconnect the current charger and replace with the new one. No cabling to be done to the boards.
 
"
2673,98860,GibboEV,Upgrading to the Fiat 500e Wallbox,"
In the UK you can get a grant of £350 to have an EV Wallbox installed. This is useful if you want to upgrade to the 7.4kW connection. The chargepoint / wallbox has to be on the government's approved list but despite there fact that here are at least 100 on there, the easyWallbox isn't listed. It's made by an italian company called Free2Move (link below) but they aren't on the list either. The Fiat dealers I have called barely understand the question, let alone have the answer. My easyWallbox is free with the car but if I had to pay for the box I would choose one on the government grant list and shop around for an installer.

Just make sure yout turn the little control knob to position 7, then download the 2nd app ""easywallbox powerup"" app, and change the safety limit to 32a 7.4kw. No issues so far. It's putting in 7KW per hour.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.

Has anyone else noticed this? I'm using scheduled charging and finding very frequently that the car ends up charging at 6A rather than 30A.













Fiat say take it to a dealer to they can pull the logs, and won't investigate otherwise. It would be good to know if this is a widespread problem. Its fairly high on the nuisance list since we rely on being able to charge different cars on different days and have an off-peak tariff.
 
"
2694,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
Picked up my new 500 today, so will look out for this issue. Probably a stupid, but related question (dealer couldn’t answer): what charging level should I be using if I’m charging the car once a week…why wouldn’t I always put it on 5? Thanks in advance.
 
"
2695,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
I don’t have a Fiat & have no experience with this…
it looks weird, with no real information on the settings 
Dumb question, how are you charging it? Is this with the granny charger? If so I’d expect it to be at the lowest level - those things are slow, not usually going over 10A
if it’s with the wall charger, do you have 7.2kw/32A (or 3.6kw/16A)
But as @TRC7 not sure why you wouldn’t always set it to “5” 

perhaps someone else will be able to be more help 🤷‍♂️
 
"

Are you on the Facebook Group? You might get a quicker response if you post there.
 
"
2697,98925,TRC7,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
@Mofo thanks. I guess to ask my question another way (and apologies if I’m taking the thread off on a tangent), is there any benefit to charging more slowly, if you don’t need a quick charge? I always thought the charge speed was determined by the power output of the charger (and size of the battery). Here, Fiat seem to be giving you an option to vary the charge speed within a particular power output, but don’t seem to explain why you would want to do that.
 
"
2698,98020,Cinquecento,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"
My seems to default to Level 3 , so when scheduling the charge , I just confirm to Level 5 . I need the Level 5 so as to charge at 7KW in my 4 hour window of cheap rate ( 5p per KW with Octopus Go ).
 
"
2699,17185,Mofo,Charge speed dropping to 1/5,"Charging more slowly can be kinder to the battery, but to a point…
rapid charging (50+kw) most damaging but can still be done many times
but the charging you do at home/destinations (7kW 32A) doesn’t make much difference, the lower settings are there for people with restrictions, such as 60A home fuse, so not enough capacity to have a full 7kW 32A, instead they’ve got 3.6kW 16A outlet, or others only have a 13A socket, so use the granny charger, these are limited to 10A (but could be put down to 6A, if you have the settings/need to), to protect the wiring/socket/connection as you don’t usually have something at 13A running full chat for maybe 12hrs, causing any weakness to overheat & possibly set fire
Though the lower Amps you charge at, the less efficient the charging is, so that’ll cost more, but this is only a tiny amount
hoping that makes some sort of sense 🙂

Two reasons to charge slowly for me. I can get 6 or 8 A 'free' on a clear day from my solar panels, and if I need to use an extension on my Tesla granny charger, I end up using the 16A adaptor rather than the 13A socket, so I need to set 3/5 to get a comfortable 10A (I have a europe friendly set of adaptors and extensions).
 
"

From in the car, you can set 3 schedules for charging and climate, and it seems independently set the charge rate in 5 stages. I'll look at charging tomorrow since I have weekend off-peak.
 
"
2705,96388,Pimpernello,Software,"
We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related.

There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful.

The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h

With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds.

The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode.

This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem.

I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing.

Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.
 
"

Collected my La Prima 3 weeks ago. It had recall Software updates installed prior to delivery, which delayed collection. I am still familiarising myself, but car is going back in hopefully for Nav update and others as Traffic Information and Tyre Pressures do not show. I can't be sure everything else is working at this stage. As to battery percentage and range , I wonder whether previous driving styles/modes are taken into consideration in the calculation of range.

Great car and opted for the electric sunroof, which is great to have.

"
2708,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored.

Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.
 
"
2709,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
Have a look at page 204 & 205 of the owners Manual. I haven't tried this yet, and not sure if my interpretation is correct .Next time I have the car in the garage , I will experiment. I to have scheduled charging set for my Octopus Go low rate :
When the charging cable is inserted and there are no charging schedules selected, the cable will be locked and the immediate charging procedure will begin. LED (B) fig. 212 and LEDs (B) fig. 211 will light up green flashing/fixed depending on the state of charge of the battery portion indicated by the LED. The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.
To switch to immediate charging mode during scheduled charging:
if charging is in progress, interrupt the scheduled charging first (see chapter ""Interrupting charging"");
activate immediate recharging by pressing the button again (A) fig. 212 on the port.
 
"
2710,98020,Cinquecento,Software,"
tsh2, I plugged in this morning, and vehicle recognised the scheduled time (00:30 - 04:30). I pressed the Black (Sealed button below the lights) in the charging port and vehicle started charging overriding the schedule. I hope this assists.
 
"
2711,97958,tsh2,Software,"Yss, I managed to get to the manual last night. It seems that the button toggles between Charge/Schedule/Stop in some way which is (to me) badly described in the manual. One of the few cases where a flowchart would make sense, I think.

It took me 3 different computers to access the manual. My phone would open it from the QR code in the short printed guide, but not download it. If I shared the same URL to my laptop, I was given a login page (which seemed to know of 2 of my email addresses already, but wouldn't let me reset passwords, would register a 3rd email - but without a password, so that is lost too). Finally, my chromebook did open the QR code link and allow me to save the document. Direct link (hosted by Fiat, not bypassing any access control) is below.

"
2712,97958,tsh2,Software,"
Quick update on the app. After waiting for a week, support in Italy confirmed that the email address which the system was expecting wasn't the one we had provided. After this was updated, we needed to re-register.

App and website are now available, but the feature set seems not what they expect. Still in contact with them, seems like they need someone with a car to debug. No charge, battery or range info at the moment. Can't set speed or ringfence alerts either.

Yes, it eventually got sorted. Wasn't clear if it was a a vehicle specific issue or general. Probably best to follow up with Fiat assist directly - their software story is certainly a bit lagging.

One thing to be aware of is the charge state isn't quite real-time, so you can't always rely on it to show how fast the car is charging.

The new Fiat 500e has been revealed and to me it looks like a very appealing prospect. Good looks, a much better interior than the current 500 and decent specs (including a 42kWh battery).

The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE.

Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box.

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

Yes. Screwfix has the best value one.
 
"
2752,102687,Koda,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
2753,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

"
2755,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Thank you, do you mean it's bad to use a public charger or the 3pin one

I don't drive far, normally I would not even do 3k miles a year, since July 2020 when I got my current car upto now I've only done 2400 miles, if we're no lockdowns I'd have done a bit more but not much I don't think
 
"
2756,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Thank you, 169.99 for the 10m one which seems ok, wish I got a free one though I assumed that came as standard anyway but I was wrong
 
"
2757,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..
 
"
2758,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Thank you for this I as you can tell am totally new to all this and sometimes it's hard to understand without a proper explanation.

I think I will get the car and see how I got with public chargers till I can afford a home wallbox, even with the grant the cheapest I saw was £500 and some upto £1200 still to pay which i don't have the money for at all.the fast chargers near me are at a pub I meet my friend at once a month and we are usually nattering for 3 hours and then walk around the shops for another hour
 
"
2759,70242,James Watson,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

That's a scary bit of kit, certainly not safe to use here, and has no safety approval at all. It can't have, as you cannot draw 3 kW from a standard BS1363 outlet, the maximum is about 2.3 kW.

How on earth sellers are allowed to sell non-approved stuff here remains a mystery. Trading Standards really should be jumping all over these people.

"
2774,105197,Mark25810,How much are granny cables and can you use any," The timer is good, I'd need 10m though I think plus the review says it's only shower proof so needs to be sheltered so not sure it would be ok as I don't have any shelter it's a open drive.

A silly question but if I plug this into the normal mains socket and into the car ...and not use the timer on the cable itself does it actually start charging right away or do you have to activate it via the car or cars app. Asking because it would be handy to set the timer via the app or car for a granny cable incase you have one without built in timer.
 
"
2775,83879,Tandy0,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Yes, it does charge immediately if you don't set the timer. There is no app. You just plug it in and press the button for how many hours delay you need. BTW, you'll need a type 2 one for the Fiat I believe.

Yeh I had to message the lease company to see if there was a free granny cable with the car but they said it only comes with the type 2 charger cable that is standard with most EV cars, so I can use that at public places that need a cable, though can't afford a home wallbox so it may not get much use as I think I will use a fast charger more

Deffo won't be getting a home charger now, watched a video on YouTube of someone going over what your house needs, we have the 100amp fuse but we do not have a new style consumer box, ours is the original that came when house was built in 79.

It's a metal flush rectangle with a metal lid that drops down and a town of black switches that turn sections of house off and then 1 bigger switch for everything turning off...that's it.
 
"
2778,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.
 
"
2779,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.
 
"
2780,4866,BogieMan,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"EBay take no responsibility for the safety of electrical items on their site.

The photo shows the adaptor partly disassembled, and the pencil shows where the earth connector and live connector touch when the shucko is inserted into the adaptor.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right? Speak to your local qualified electrician. You can get fixed up a lot cheaper than you might think. 7kw will charge the 500 overnight with ease. A granny charger twice as long.

2782,97138,D4m0,Kids in the backseat,"
Hi all,

So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e!

It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it

I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car!

Thanks!

I don’t know what Renault were thinking, they have a crazy good formula with the Zoe for price vs range/spec… then throwing it away for the sake of a few safety features, mind blowing! Really like the styling of the 500e thou… just the kids are the concern before we commit.

We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR)

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO.

Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.

I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e...

I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching.
I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK.
The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

Two kids aged 9 and 7 with backless boosters working fine so far. Only issue is they find it hard pushing the seatbelt into the buckle - which is at an angle - I am inserting something under it to try and stop the buckles falling back in the holders.

Anyone else looking forward to the new 500e finally reaching our shores next year? Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

Already had the nice Fiat lady from Italy calling to keep me informed and to congratulate me on my good taste in cars...

I'll post any updates here!

I really like the look of them, especially the fabric roof like you say - not enough convertible EVs! This is half way there... 

I also think it is a really nice evolution of the new Fiat 500 design. The interior looks fantastic. 

Looking forward to some photos when you get yours!

2797,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"We‘ve had a reservation for one since April 2020, it’s a replacement for wife’s current Twin Air 500. Personally I think Fiat have nailed it with this, more than any other manufacturer. The internal and external styling is spot on and I can’t wait to have a spin in it. Sure it won’t be as fast as my current car but I know which one I’d rather be in on the coast roads in the summer.......

I have also registered my interest in the New 500 La Prima. There is a frustrating lack of real information on the UK website.
However it is possible to configure a La Prima on the Fiat Italy website, which gives a better idea of the specification (albeit in Italian).
Of course UK spec might be a bit different.

Elmo will be offering it as a subscription car (all included, no deposit).
It is the Fiat 500e La prima 42kWh, know if it’s the convertible only or not, but it’s a car I was surprised of liking myself (not the convertible).
Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

Once the initial demand has subsided, they will likely offer some good deals as this is FCA’s leading car to offset all those Jeeps and Maseratis.
 
"
2806,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"That's interesting.
On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
2807,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.
 
"

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.
 
"
2817,7126,MarkyM,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

What does your Leaf use? Chademo or the later model Type 2? My Zappi 2 uses a Type 2 socket.
 
"
2820,25425,Mickeypeach,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"The noise was fine, my wife currently has a mini convertible so she is used to extra noises.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

Going to sound silly but what does it come with. 

The salesman has said we get;

Can anyone shed any light on this?

2832,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

2839,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.
 
"
2840,13593,tophatron,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.
 
"
2844,247,Charlie S,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now 
 
"
2845,7126,MarkyM,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.
 
"
2847,5306,srichards,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.
 
"
2848,3413,Oilymo,Fiat 500e Convertible La Prima Test Drive/Review,"
We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Hi,
We are close to ordering a new fiat 500e, but I am interested in the service intervals and cost. The dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles..? Is this correct for an electric car.? Surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts.?
If anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated.

I've contacted my local dealer (not the one supplying ) and they said they didn't have any details on frequency nor cost ....... There's cars being driven I find it pretty unacceptable tbh. 

They said 'ah well - the cars probably won't need servicing for 12 months so we've got plenty of time'.......

Also we're picking ours up in September. We didn't get offered the servicing package. Is that a fiat wide offer or something the dealer can elect to provide?

Because most EV's have regenerative braking (to put energy back into the battery when slowing down or going downhill), the friction brakes do not get as much regular use as with ICE cars, so brake discs can get rusty through little use.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Anyone else looking forward to the new 500e finally reaching our shores next year? Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

Already had the nice Fiat lady from Italy calling to keep me informed and to congratulate me on my good taste in cars...

I'll post any updates here!

I really like the look of them, especially the fabric roof like you say - not enough convertible EVs! This is half way there... 

I also think it is a really nice evolution of the new Fiat 500 design. The interior looks fantastic. 

Looking forward to some photos when you get yours!

Personally I think Fiat have nailed it with this, more than any other manufacturer. The internal and external styling is spot on and I can’t wait to have a spin in it. Sure it won’t be as fast as my current car but I know which one I’d rather be in on the coast roads in the summer.......

I have also registered my interest in the New 500 La Prima. There is a frustrating lack of real information on the UK website.
However it is possible to configure a La Prima on the Fiat Italy website, which gives a better idea of the specification (albeit in Italian).
Of course UK spec might be a bit different.

Elmo will be offering it as a subscription car (all included, no deposit).
It is the Fiat 500e La prima 42kWh, know if it’s the convertible only or not, but it’s a car I was surprised of liking myself (not the convertible).
Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

"
3011,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"That's interesting.
On the Italian site there are no factory options for the La Prima version.
Did the dealer mention what it includes? Cabin heat pump maybe?

Also by coincidence I've been driving a Caesium Blue IPace for two years
(and returned it when the PCP ended in November)!
 
"
3012,3413,Oilymo,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"Yes I thought it was odd as the car was supposed to fully loaded but wife and I wondered if it’s simply not needed in parts of the Med hence an option in the North of Europe. I also wonder if the sales guy knows what he’s doing! We haven’t paid extra for it.

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.

3013,23281,RichT,'La Prima' first edition of 2021 500e,"
I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

Hello there. 
Have had my car now for 4 months. Thinking about how to trick the line control system to avoid holding the steering wheel. On Tesla you use a weight, but on 500 it must be a proximity and heat sensor in the steering wheel. Have tested myself with different materials and found that plastic bottle with water works. But how to turn it into a practical gadget for self-driving?

Any ideas?

Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box.

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.
 
"
3024,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

"
3028,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

My biggest problem being that there isn’t a foot rest for your left foot, so I end up just sort of resting it under the brake, which not only feels awkward, but a little dangerous.

Also no height adjustment on the seat, I’m 6ft and I feel like my head is up very high.

I'm not sure about the electric 500, but the original (new original, not original original) was based on the Panda, which was short narrow and tall. I bought one new in 2005. It had a high driving position, which made best use of the interior space.
 
"
3046,102460,Ethanedwards,Driving position uncomfortable,"
Your lucky having a seat height adjustment. I have the Red edition with only the 'four way seats' . Not the optional 'six way seats'. So no height adjustments. 
I wish they'd explained this better when buying. Course if you have the posh versions this probably isn't an issue. Myself being 6ft4 I'd like to lower the seat my wife being 5ft4 has a booster cushion. We manage ok. 
Oh my Foxhound mix dog think 40kg Fat Labrador size. Due to a pressing need to get to the vets whilst I was away from home with the usual Mokka dog taxi . She had to carry Bailey in the 500. He popped in and was really quickly at home on the back seats. We don't use the back at all but at a push it's surprisingly roomy. I spent 25mins this afternoon vacuuming his fur off the seats. Love the dog but how he moults!

Deffo won't be getting a home charger now, watched a video on YouTube of someone going over what your house needs, we have the 100amp fuse but we do not have a new style consumer box, ours is the original that came when house was built in 79.

Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.
 
"
3076,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right?

Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box.

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end?

I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot

I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.

As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available.

There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year.

OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.

3086,75416,,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"
The issue is solely to do with charging from a standard home outlet, using a 13 A plug in charge point. They draw a steady 10 A for hours on end, and sometimes that is just more than the outlet can safely handle, leading to overheating. There's also the small risk from an open PEN fault with charging like this.

A properly installed charge point will have all the required safety protection and will also be wired to a supply that can safely carry a high current for hours on end, so is a very much lower risk overall.

Public charging is just as safe as charging from a properly installed home charge point, and a lot safer than charging from a 13 A plug in charge point..

Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A?

I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A.

My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.

Yeh I had to message the lease company to see if there was a free granny cable with the car but they said it only comes with the type 2 charger cable that is standard with most EV cars, so I can use that at public places that need a cable, though can't afford a home wallbox so it may not get much use as I think I will use a fast charger more

Deffo won't be getting a home charger now, watched a video on YouTube of someone going over what your house needs, we have the 100amp fuse but we do not have a new style consumer box, ours is the original that came when house was built in 79.

It's a metal flush rectangle with a metal lid that drops down and a town of black switches that turn sections of house off and then 1 bigger switch for everything turning off...that's it.

Why does the type of CU make any difference?

Charge points are best wired via a connection box to the tails, not a good idea to wire one to a CU unless there is no other option, really. The reasons are mainly that few CUs have the capacity to add a double pole RCBO, or RCD and MCB, fitting a high continuous load circuit into a CU may present an increased risk from heat build up, particularly for older boards with plastic cases and often the wiring run can be simpler and less disruptive if it comes from the tails rather than the CU.

3140,3499,SHL-Kelso,How much are granny cables and can you use any,"Most EVSE installers would most likely take the feed directly from the tails at the meter (raul there than adding a new circuit to an existing consumer unit or fuse box), and use a small dedicated consumer unit just for the new charger circuit, to avoid the need to check/test/upgrade/replace the existing consumer unit. This allows the new install to be fully compliant with the regs and be fully tested independently of the existing installations. Obviously if there are issues with the meter position/cut-out that need addressing first then this work would be additional, but it leaves the existing consumer unit untouched.

I bought an adaptor for Shucko to 3 pin from eBay and when I used it the fuse tripped. The photo shows the adaptor partly disassembled, and the pencil shows where the earth connector and live connector touch when the shucko is inserted into the adaptor. EBay were not interested, the only recourse is to get your money back if you’re still alive.
There is a pressure group trying to change this but they are not getting very far unfortunately.

Why aren't you getting a wallbox? Until 22nd June you can install a ""dumb"" charger. Which are significantly cheaper. After then you must install a smart charger that allows the charging network to control your charger. Cos allowing the authorities to override your life is always best right? Speak to your local qualified electrician. You can get fixed up a lot cheaper than you might think. 7kw will charge the 500 overnight with ease. A granny charger twice as long.
