How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.

You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.

13,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

Noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric Fiat 500 are now on Youtube from the German reviewers.

The most interesting one that I came across is linked below (links jumps to charging section), however due to its length the auto generated closed captions aren't available.

Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger

Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW
26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time
42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve
At 85% charge rate drops to 13kW
Around 29 minutes from 7% to 85% - 29.4 kWh delivered in that time

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun.

A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout!
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.
 
","
Biffa
"
12,"
Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.
 
","
Panda
"
13,"roundabouts, lane changes, an increased chance on quiet roads that you might drive on the wrong side of the road, increased insurance costs, that reflect both increased collision risk and potential difficulty obtaining parts a fewer authorised repairers...

What advantages does bringing it over give you opposed to sourcing a local car?

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:

15,"@Wastedspacer what is the situation with the 500e, are the indicators white, red or amber?

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

Blanik
"
18,"Thanks for the suggestion and certainly a good point, I did check some options out the last time we were there. Zoe's are ok but not so easy to manoeuver and certainly not as much of a fun ride as the 500e. The 500e is incredibly nimble, great visibility and easy to park, the Zoe was certainly comfortable and had decent visibility but seemed to have the turning circle of a double-decker! The other downside to the most reasonably priced Zoe's were the rental batteries. .

Found this advisory suggesting import duties won't be an issue:

""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document ""

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Hi,
We are close to ordering a new fiat 500e, but I am interested in the service intervals and cost. The dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles..? Is this correct for an electric car.? Surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts.?
If anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated.

I've contacted my local dealer (not the one supplying ) and they said they didn't have any details on frequency nor cost ....... There's cars being driven I find it pretty unacceptable tbh. 

They said 'ah well - the cars probably won't need servicing for 12 months so we've got plenty of time'.......

Also we're picking ours up in September. We didn't get offered the servicing package. Is that a fiat wide offer or something the dealer can elect to provide?

I spoke to the dealer again when we placed our order yesterday... and they confirmed service is every 12 months...! This is ridiculous, my Skoda enyaq is every 24 months...!

Because most EV's have regenerative braking (to put energy back into the battery when slowing down or going downhill), the friction brakes do not get as much regular use as with ICE cars, so brake discs can get rusty through little use.

Do any other 500e drivers have issues with the intelligent speed assist system?, My La Prima seems to identify signs correctly, but after a period of not seeing a sign, it checks the sat nav, and it appears to convert the sat nav speed from km to miles..... So a 30 sat nav signal displays as 20 mph.... 60 as 40mph etc. Lovely car, but this software bug is very annoying, and Fiat does not seem to have any answers!!!

I think it would depend on the spec you want. The dealer network have some models in stock, or on order, so depending on your requirements, you may get lucky with a car in stock, or maybe one that is on order but not locked down, so you could add extras/colour options, but that would probably be 3 month wait for build and delivery.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch.

Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged.

So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

The other downside to the most reasonably priced Zoe's were the rental batteries. .

Hi there 

I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april.

So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol.

Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too.

I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol.

i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh.

anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3 

would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one.

many thanks

Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.

13,"Hi, I am looking to swap the wifes car from a kia picanto to the fiat 500 electric Red edition. I am used to electric as i have had an Ipace for the last year. Does the fiat have programmable pre conditioning so the the heater comes on at a set time each day, can it be set via an app and manually in the car ?
My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.
Cheers if you can assist.

Apologies if I've missed a thread on this, but I couldn't find one.

The new Fiat 500e has been revealed and to me it looks like a very appealing prospect. Good looks, a much better interior than the current 500 and decent specs (including a 42kWh battery).

The prices sound keen and I think it would make a great alternative to the Mini Cooper SE and Honda e.

We are looking at a car for my wife, and it was between the Mini e and the Honda e, but I think we will wait and look at the Fiat 500 e convertible, she already has a Mini convertible.

The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE.

I have also just collected my Passion, so I feel your pain because I had the same issue.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

However, I have not got tyre pressures either. Not sure how to resolve that one.

I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to : How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper

Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?

Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991 https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?

Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun.

Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import.

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it.

But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above.

Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.

Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry

So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout.

Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.

Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).
 
","
Kiltox
"

When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months.

If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.

Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.

Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria.

Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.
 
","
Biffa
"
12,"
Do it! 

There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me  Sounds perfect for bombing round town.
 
","
Panda
"
13,"roundabouts, lane changes, an increased chance on quiet roads that you might drive on the wrong side of the road, increased insurance costs, that reflect both increased collision risk and potential difficulty obtaining parts a fewer authorised repairers...

I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc. 

If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!

I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.

I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch. 
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear. 
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.

Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:

15,"@Wastedspacer what is the situation with the 500e, are the indicators white, red or amber?

If they cannot be adjusted, pair of headlamps on ebay for the car are £40 each and if you had to change the rear lights £25 a each, add a fog light and you should be done!

Having had a look at some UK Fiat 500 and the 500e (Thanks ebay.com) the units look pretty much identical i.e. the lenses don't appear to be coloured differently

I wonder if the fog light button is a blank and wiring is behind it still!

Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!

Blanik
"
18,"Thanks for the suggestion and certainly a good point, I did check some options out the last time we were there. Zoe's are ok but not so easy to manoeuver and certainly not as much of a fun ride as the 500e. The 500e is incredibly nimble, great visibility and easy to park, the Zoe was certainly comfortable and had decent visibility but seemed to have the turning circle of a double-decker! The other downside to the most reasonably priced Zoe's were the rental batteries. .

Found this advisory suggesting import duties won't be an issue:

""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document ""

While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth:

1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot.
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle.
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts.

Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!

Apologies if I've missed a thread on this, but I couldn't find one.

The new Fiat 500e has been revealed and to me it looks like a very appealing prospect. Good looks, a much better interior than the current 500 and decent specs (including a 42kWh battery).

The prices sound keen and I think it would make a great alternative to the Mini Cooper SE and Honda e.

That appears to be the price for the ""loaded"" first editions (which is another general trend for car launches), they seem to be targeting a £21-25k figure for the regular models (including the £3k grant).

We are looking at a car for my wife, and it was between the Mini e and the Honda e, but I think we will wait and look at the Fiat 500 e convertible, she already has a Mini convertible. Once the lower costs are revealed, then I cannot see why if you are after a small car, you would choose the more expensive, shorter range cars (Mini and Honda e)

The New Fiat 500 Electric: Three Types, Two Battery Options


Fiat recently introduced its third body version of the new 500 model - the 3+1, with small rear doors - which will join the hatchback and cabrio.

The 24kWh battery in the lowest model is a bit disappointing as it plays into the ""too little range for the price"" narrative that's surrounded cars like the Honda e and Mini Cooper SE. The 42kWh models look good though and the prices are reasonable, especially if they get the usual Fiat discounts...

I have also just collected my Passion, so I feel your pain because I had the same issue.

However, after following some advice, I have now got the battery level indicator on the app. The resolution is to create a charge schedule on the car system (not the app). And then the battery state appears on the app.

However, I have not got tyre pressures either. Not sure how to resolve that one.

My ipace has a heated screen but i have never used it as i set preconditioning every day before going to work, would this work the same in the fiat ?
Due to the wife wanting red interior, she cannot have heated seats, no idea why but there you are, so it would be an extra £300 just for the heated wipers, are these any good, and if the car pre conditions, do you need them.

Dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 3.12 kWh/mile but costs low combined with a few free PodPoints and overnight tariff works out at 1.8p/mile so overall PCP and running costs favour EV over a new petrol Fiat 500. Basically if you spend over £100/month on petrol and range is enough (160 miles) then 500e should be 1st choice for Fiat fans.

Anyone else keep stats?

Anyone else looking forward to the new 500e finally reaching our shores next year? Put my name down for this first edition of the new 500e as I love the idea of the canvas roof version (an original Tesla Roadster is out of my budget!). Made contact with my local dealer who's expecting a delivery date of March 2021.

I have also registered my interest in the New 500 La Prima. There is a frustrating lack of real information on the UK website.

Elmo will be offering it as a subscription car (all included, no deposit).
It is the Fiat 500e La prima 42kWh, know if it’s the convertible only or not, but it’s a car I was surprised of liking myself (not the convertible).
Still need to see the price.


















The ELMO DRIVE Discussion thread


Worked off Zeddy so can’t complain. Nice and toasty warm. Just managed to do it using Siri as well so helloooo peak laziness. Should I be concerned about the battery though? Granted I’ve not charged it fully, and it’s quite cold, but it went down 20% in 18 miles today, mix of national speed...

The iPace is great but haven’t had a chance to really take it for a long run which is a shame, I want to see if I can get anywhere near 3 miles/KWh. It is also my first non VW in 25 years so fingers crossed for trouble free motoring. We came from a Golf GTE which was fantastic but just too small for the growing family. The Caesium Blue is amazing and quite striking from a distance.

I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey).
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers.
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).

And we have put a deposit on a La Prima Cabrio. Due in September. It was absolutely pouring when we drove it, so only had the roof down for 2 minutes, will ask for another drive when it's sunnier. My wife loved the car, it's more comfortable than the Mini E and the ID3 is too big for her needs.

So that’s at least 3 of who have experienced the 500e and all of us have been impressed! Surprised that September is delivery time. End of the summer by then. Why such a delay? Car was announced last year was it not and appeared at dealers last month. That is almost another 5 months away. 
What was the cabrio roof like in the rain? Really noisy with the rain battering down? Only ever had a hard top convertible/roadster (Daihatsu Copen) so not familiar with day to day living with a canvas roof. 
It really did bring the fun back to have an open top drive and kind of cool that now it was in an EV.

Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it.

Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off.

Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then. The hotel sold us a coffee but they were booked up and no chance of any food 🙁 Pick up was 4pm - finally got home about 9pm. As my wife said that was exactly the sort of experience she expected but didn’t want to have!

How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands!
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today.
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range.
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc. 
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk.

Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly.
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV.

And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster)
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that.
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that!
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise.
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one. 
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?% 

As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!

Nice review, I am having a test drive on Tuesday, can I ask what sort of discounts were offered, see we were both looking at the Ioniq 5 on an other forum.

I saw Jonny Smith’s early review of this and thought it looked great.

I work in the NHS and with their finance package -Affinity? Would give a £2k discount Straight off For NHS workers. I Will have to read up on it. New car/new model but I am sure as Fiat dealers they can still do a deal.

I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.

We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.

Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable. 
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat. 
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell!

Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.

You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.

Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?

Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.

Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.

Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now

13,"Drove the Mini e, BMW i3S (we own the regular BMW i3 already) and Peugeot e-208 all in 1 afternoon last summer 2020. Wife was choosing her next car. Was driving an Audi S3 (300bhp+) at the time.

Mini e runs the BMW i3s running gear -181bhp motor (instead of 184bhp in the i3S) but to the front wheels. It is a powerful and fun car to drive but we found the ride too harsh and unsettled overall for our British urban pot holed and bumpy roads but excellent if the tarmac was smooth. As there is so much torque going through the front wheels you get torque steer pretty much all the time on acceleration which the cheeky nature of the car urges you to do all the time! And we test drove on a nice sunny day. Would be worse in the rain.- a big no-no for me. I prefer rear wheel drive (eg-i3) as a result. A pain to get in the back as 3 door only, but once there actually ok for headroom but if you are tall driver rear legroom is going to be an issue. Pretty tiny boot and no frunk as this is based on the ICE Mini platform. Without the sunroof, car will feel claustrophobic and cramped but actually plenty of room for front passengers. Well equipped overall. 
As it is a fun car, the powerful running gear counts against it, as the range will be poor if you drive it in a fun/Mini sort of way. Pretty efficient drivetrain as 7+ years of BMW e-platform experience has gone in to it (much better than the similar battery sized Honda e) but you still have to expect 90-110 miles real world range.

500e has a bigger battery but just felt more modern. Same issues with cramped rear. Not as powerful but more than fast enough and no real torque steer as not as much torque I guess going through the front wheels. 500e rides better also- but close overall.

After driving all 3 last year, wife chose the Peugeot e-208. Liked the looks of it above all else (subjective) but thought the cabin was Audi like in quality and build. Another surprise. After almost 5 months she still absolutely loves it and to be fair I have been very very impressed with it. We both love our sports cars and they should be fun above all else. The e-208 is certainly that. GT model fully loaded with pano sunroof. Seems to better and more fun than the Corsa e which shares it's platform. 

I know you asked about the Mini e but e-208 is proper 5 seater (at a squeeze)- Mini strict 4 seater only and cramped at that. e-208 has a more useful boot. Bigger battery at 50kWh and faster charging speed at up to 100kw (Mini 33kWh battery?-Still only 50kW charge speed). 

500e- 85kW which is fast enough to charge a 40-45kWh battery. 

And the 208 is Europes best selling car, which came as a surprise to us, but not really now we come to think of it. Peugeot 2008, Europes 2nd best selling car to boot! Yes they are both available as petrol, diesel and electric models but they must have done something right to knock the typical Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio or VW Golf off their perches!

If it is between the 500e and Mini I would take the 500e. It is a proper and very modern high quality feeling (la Prima edition sampled only) EV with a decent sized battery and range and good enough charge speeds. If you can live with the smallish boot (very small on the convertible as it has small boot opening also) and cramped rear space. It will be an excellent commuting car as fun also.

Mini e is a converted EV on an ageing platform but then again is tried and tested. BMW/Mini will be releasing a new ground up Mini EV in conjunction with Great Wall Motors of China (I believe) in the coming months.Probably early to mid 2022.

Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.

What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm. 

Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.

We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything @MarkyM said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks…

Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.

Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.
